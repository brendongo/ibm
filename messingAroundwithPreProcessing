[Menú] daily of a child [obeso] : not [desayuna] and dinner pressed
than of a third of the children with age 25-to-30 between the 9 and 13 years have problems of obesity where the obesity affects the 9 % of the population school and the obesity the 5 %
The children overweight from in their majority of families with a lifestyle of life that not is healthy according is from of investigations current
It again to demonstrate what is the importance the environment where is overall for a development healthy of the person so as the models that serve of reference
In the table the children [obsesos] is fuel by example of pressed the least with the double of often that the children of families with weight normal
For at more the 19 % of the overweight had [cenado] potatoes [fritas] the day before the analysis the which is linked the programme of prevention &apos; The obesity not is a [casualidad] &apos;
In the families of children with obesity not is preparation of people sports what which is applies to the most of the families current where only the 15 % of the children replied that their parents the least a time by week are time to the exercise physical
Survey so to 900 children
The survey is was to end of last year school and took in the same almost 900 children of Education [Básica] of whole keeping
already was the second edition the programme of &apos; The obesity of not is a [casualidad] &apos; that supports the [Compañía] of certain [Sanitario] General and the company [Unilever]
far now have participated in the project more of 12 billion children from the [4º] to the [8º] course
A [dieta] appropriate and quite exercise in family are factors [determinantes] that do decrease a the number of children with obesity and even obesity
&apos; only the half of the children [encuestados] have would that have five served joys according the regime : Breakfast lunch food [merienda] and dinner that is a of the conditions in to a [dieta] healthy &apos; - one of the results of the survey
However Breakfast but with [embutido] for at
The specialists [avisan] of that in a development healthy are important also the details that also have as by example have a time set to the Breakfast in family
In keeping not However only the 23 % of the families of schoolchildren [desayunan] to the same time
In the most of the families each one [desayuna] only
But what worst was be that in the 10 % of the who not is [desayuna] nothing
The Breakfast is without However the basis of a [dieta] daily right
The study shows that in the families of children overweight is consume with very more often the [insanas] potatoes [fritas]
Almost all - regardless of weight - they to daily [refrescos] [dulces] ( 70 % )
is rule general do sport more the 40 % of the children [encuestados] without However pronounced their parents this result is reduces to least of the half only the 15 %
[Fabrícate] your [dieta]
The next stage of study [posibilitó] that the [chavales] elected ( [204] boys and [172] girls of 13 schools ) is [creasen] their own which to from of all the at possible according their tastes and views
&apos; The preferences food of the children Czech in age 25-to-30 between the 12 and 15 years from the point of view of a food healthy are very removed of what ideal &apos;
Among their food favourite is are the [pasta] the meat and the [dulces]
&apos; is on all alarming the popularity of the [refrescos] [dulces] &apos; is by in the report end the study
As food main is has the [palma] the [pasta] and to still of close the meat of [ave]
less the children reject always the [legumbre] and the will by the fish and the I is very under
[Cambio] to habits made
At same time the study shows that the children are prepared to change their habits food if receive the information fair
&apos; In the group of control of the participants in the study that [rellenaron] the [cuestionario] after of end the programme of prevention &apos; The obesity not is a [casualidad] &apos; is was in many cases a change important to favour of the principles of a food healthy &apos; is as in the results of study
[Llama] the attention by example what concerning to the [refrescos] [dulces] where many children [empezarían] to [preferir] the water normal and aware
The children also [elegirían] with more often in the [cuestionario] the meat of [ave] and the fish for the food main and [restringirían] the consumption of food fresh and the derivatives of [harina]
The [estilista] has of be also a good psychologist maintain the professionals
In the Article [introductorio] How about the [estilistas] already I [quejé] a little of that the lessons initial already were quite [cargadas]
not had or idea of how would for
[Conferencias] of three professionals of [ramo] how he to - problem and also a seminar on how works in the world the spectacle
And will worst
observance more close are the examinations end more information and tasks practices us [aguardan]
And but the course is develops every Saturday and Sunday already not There a [alfiler]
We time have studied with the there [Alena] ( in the course not there no man ) on how he to the woman that not has a [simetría] perfect
And so is the great majority
&apos;So is [cuellicorto] someone has a on [estilizada] without the [curvas] right and someone suffering obesity
The [estilista] has of know arise [ópticamente] a shoulders [anchos] [alargar] a bottleneck or [recrear] the [curvas] necessary
We have given certain noticed on how do I the body of women of kind of [Jennifer] oxide of [pechos] and [caderas] enormous but [cintura] close and the same time not [vestirla] of a way too [desafiante]
If by example the difference between the [cintura] and the [caderas] is so that the skirt or the trousers not is [adaptan] is the worth done [coser] the least a paper of separatist [extra] to measure
However doubt not is [arrepentirán] because the clothes that where perfectly is [impagable]
With a skirt to measure is relieved a best that with a that not to of get [levantarse] [baila] in the [cintura] etc
The body [estilizado] is can allow he clothes with [pliegues] [adornos] [bordados] or [drapeados]
There certainly many types of information various and of bodies so that I readjust of that have of whole the week for to order in my head whole this information
E even so I afraid that with the task [asignada] already I more that of too
to each participant in the course is to have allocated two famous to the that must solutions two [vestuarios] : one to the day and another to the night
There that have in account the aspect current the lifestyle of fashionable that is [adecue] to the person in question
I has [tocado] &apos; he &apos; to [Miranda] Kerr perhaps the [conozcáis] of the campaign of Victoria &apos; &apos;s [Secret]
[Grito] by within to me is a best that by example [Britney] [Spears] or [Christina] [Aguilera] that recently will [engordado] a hundred 75-kilo ( by favour have in account the That ) or the [jovencísima] [Selena] [Gómez]
The I have that [recortarlos] of the weeklies or [buscarlos] in Internet and [imprimirlos] to after [elaborarlos] wholeheartedly
The [moodboard] that is as is way the result completely This also our lifestyle staff and our relationship with the design [gráfico]
is important also think in the part [gráfica] of [estilismo]
The [estilista] by therefore not [viste] only physically but that also is as by example of the pages of products in the weeklies ( of subjects specific as trends [bolsos] coats etc )
In all this we spoke the [estilista] and leather Mauro [Kameník]
But all this already is to the Sunday
The [estilista] has of have a vision global
The three invited specialists him the conference of Saturday with information on all kind of bodies
The [estilista] [Honza] [Pokorný] the leather of fashionable [Jakub] [Polanka] and the [fotógrafo] of fashionable Ben [Renč]
[Jakub] us reminded that the fashionable is a illusion and the [estilista] should [saberle] from party to this
And a good [estilista] know work with a same [prenda] of he of forms various
The [variabilidad] is in this case fundamental
So the such [gabardina] ( or as say in English [trench-coat] ) is can he to what stale with [vaqueros] and [camiseta] but also serves to he the body half-naked with shoes of [tacón] and [fotografiarlo] as if it in reality a clothing
Or well enough [arremangarla] and higher the bottleneck to obtain a image completely different
&apos; [Jugad] with this &apos; us discussed
What that more [valoro] is the next board : &apos; For start to work ago lack that first [conozcáis] all the rules &apos;
&apos; Then already &quot; [romperlas] &apos; said [Jakub]
is end I is clear by what [memorizamos] all these Interesting what is being with what by what if then is that in the weeklies of fashionable us are results different
That without about of the [desfiles]
you the [fotógrafo] Ben know that a [estilista] has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the that intended [fotografiar]
So for a history of fashionable that have ten pages ( by therefore ten [outfits] ) there that have splendid lists to use the least fifteen
And also that the photos the clothes works in combination with other [prendas] all them different to the that is mines in the reality
all this there that times in account to the time of solutions the [outfit]
[Honza] [Pokorný] us was that the image and the lifestyle excessive them alone in many cases the half of success
only look to [Madonna] that not is precisely a as an but the image and the [márquetin] have fact of it a star world
In keeping by the time not there still a trend clear to use the services of the [estilistas]
far the - famous also what are pointless ( I mere my skills my aspect physical not has so importance )
And when someone us [pida] our services there that have in account that is very likely that we [indiquen] a stature very different to the their real ( will )
Then only is [guglear] and physically if the weeklies of heart already have writing on the issue if a certain [celebridad] has [engordado] / [adelgazado] etc
The Sunday [Honza] and Mario us [insistieron] in that the [estilista] not to enough [orientarse] in the fashionable but that has that understand of [outfit]
During their work on all is must communicate with the people to the that [viste] by what that is fundamental be a good psychologist
dumb appreciate to the people not is ago of least stand their views
&apos; When a there you [contrata] to that to [clasifiquéis] the [vestuario] and is what [completéis] with [prendas] fine not &quot; take and throwing all what that had and say : &apos; [huy] what horror &apos; &apos;
&apos; [Encontrad] the least a couple of things that [podáis] [ponderar] and recommend for that someone is the can to &apos; says Mario
He same also us was that all must [caber] in the so-called &apos; [placovka] &apos; is say the stock of work
This is set around of the [cintura] and is have there all the tools necessary
are items as nail as nail [quitapelusas] or [imperdibles] There also balance of [nailon] ( that to serves the [estilista] for the session of photos of products such that [bolsos] or [gorros] ) [pinzas] special of [enganche] of [prendas] by front if this outside greater ( the [alfileres] and other kind of [enganches] not are [permitidos] therefore could damage the fabric ) or a at of remnant
For not slogans in the usual [pasiva] and to something in practice we learned to [revestir] the [suela] of the shoes
Even for the part-session of photos in the study in a surface flat is could damage the [suela] and a more still the foreign
And not did more that [revestir] and [revestir]
not We play the shoes with the nail to not [dañarlos] by accident
So that had that be very [hábil]
Mauro I has given a joy the who my work without reserves
The truth is that not is I are very well these skills
This is only a small part of all the that we heard for all the end of week in the second part the course
already I I given account that commit the [estilismo] to level professional not is a way of rose-tinted but I of exactly as what that telling the people
In [Need] for [Speed] : The [Run] is disappear by whole America
[Reseña]
A journey in principle [despreocupado] is complicates to cause of a series of [descuidos] [impropios] of a journey routine for the time of tomorrow
In certain measure is managed cover the expectations but this not serves of nothing if in reality not is intended do nothing so
The new over to the that the title is adds The [Run] kindled large expectations already before of their [estreno]
[Prometía] that would new [aires] to the former [saga] of to [Need] for [Speed] and to result of what shown is as a at that not should end being other time a gender of action without more
also we we [curiosos] by know how bee the scenes [insertadas] where the like main share the car and wearing by their own ordinary
As is happen in the [series] of [NFS] the results not an great thing regard to what that us those
There to that is can give by volumes but in the [cómputo] total is Some points to cause of failures absurd that already come [apareciendo] in the number from ago years
In reality not is can or calling errors but that is is more well of the [desgana] incomprehensible of the [programadores]
The adventure starts very well
It you predictability in a history whose leading as has certain problems personal ; for [resolverlos] is to does participate in a career illegal by whole America
[Os] [sentáis] the [volante] in the at dressed in St Franz and tardiness mission is to the first to New York
The idea is offer something interesting
The route is into in ten stages and then in more of fifty to
In this is follows that each career has place by a route different and the stages are [localizadas] in different environments that are quite various and interesting
In that way one not has or [remotamente] the that of that the at will always what same
Some of the environments are even [agradables] to the view but the level technical of [gráfico] is equivalent the of evidence previous of the series
is therefore not is nothing of another world
But the walk by the desert the landscape [otoñal] or the high mountains covered of snow is a effect about very way
In the to is [diversifican] of time in when by a element [atípico]
So by example in the desert you [encontráis] a storm of bit that ever the visibility
In change in the mountains there that have care for that not you [sepulte] a [avalancha]
According that each a of the to is very well developed
only there a couple of models but with that enough
During a time [intentáis] [adelantar] to a amount of rival [exigida] ( what normal in a career classical ) after [tratáis] of win time ( duel stale [cronometrado] ) and then you expected a duel against a only [adversario]
In a of all this is to times the police that not ago but obstruct still more the things
The - are the landscape outside the car
It have [animaciones] [interactivas] when as in the most of the cases has of escape of someone and you you that [ayudarlo] always [pulsando] the [botón] fair in the time fair
Nothing complicated
is surprising without However that has enough least landscape in the at of what that be wait ( in particular there only three )
But the result end is positive because this element not is to be upsetting and in the context already mentioned is one of the elements that do that the at it more interesting
The model of underlined still the fingerprinting of the episodes previous
That to say that to day of today already not be great thing but not is can that that be There
If [buscáis] a [simulación] realistic already &quot; to in other part
But to a career office-bound with quite action to appropriate quite this lifestyle of underlined but we find something better between the games of the competition
far here all in order
But the problems emerge after of a true time
to difference of what right of the models of underlined already not happens what same with the collisions
In games of this kind not There wait that [recree] [deformaciones] and collisions complicated but of fact before of a coup against any subject not &quot; predict how [reaccionará] [vuestro] prosecution with what which not all is in order
is typical that the do a [adelantamiento] very [ajustado] or able the prosecution with a traffic normal so only has covered [roces] but in other situations almost identical [vuestro] prosecution just doing [piruetas] [descontroladas]
Or even has completely destroyed
you the system of [reseteo] not emerge large problems but can [poneros] of is humour
The [reseteos] are [programados] of such way that when [sufres] a accident or you [sales] of the back the at you [restituye] the last point of rescue in the back
However However in every career only is at of five [reseteos] available
If the [consumís] all you that restart the career from the principle
So therefore not is more that a aid in case of that something not will well but not is very of [fiar]
to times or the [reseteo] aid only aid the [aprenderse] the stage upsurge of memory
A great disadvantage the at is that the ourselves facts is are in different places
In some [curvas] by example there that into of a way specific ; of another way are being of take
Others times you [encontráis] in some website vehicles &apos; civilians &apos; always with the same configuration but [estéis] the first [quintos] or [lleguéis] five minutes before or after
This ago of [rabiar] on all in situations when [veis] that two [autos] that will the I in directions suppress your [contrincante] [adelanta] without problems but when [llegáis] [debéis] [girar] or well ruthless
is as when [lleguéis] because is programmed by that the &apos; surprise &apos; always will front of release [narices]
The adversaries have also a advantage more
During whole the starting [llegaréis] to websites where without have in account the time always you [adelantará] the same [adversario] in the same website
In this happens the end of the starting in a long bridge what which is still more [chocante]
[Vuestro] [oponente] must to before that you the price that be
When is front of you you difficult the vision of the [autos] that come of with so that the principle &quot; do [papilla] the car
It can understand the idea of create a at with profit takes of [suspense] and [adrenalina] but the execution is so reveal that surely you [decepcione] delay
And is a worth because but the model of journey be simple the at is fun and with action of way that to often not is possible to the detail what that is or where
And really of as if the merit is has the idea with fifty runs standardise or the classification in the career to that not [quepa] the platitude or any other thing
A idea [inhabitual] is the change of [autos] for the to
You that be to to the [surtidores] of petrol the hand of the road because precisely there you that change of prosecution but in the great majority of the cases you suffice what that you
The [autos] is into in three categories
The sport are We for areas urban the [autos] strong Americans to the motorways [rectas] and the [exóticos] [superdeportivos] to a underlined technical by example by roads of mountain with [curvas]
In balance [narrativo] main also is a balance of challenges parallel is say there to in places specific that [conoceréis] by the stories
here [conseguiréis] not only rich but also points of experience for [vuestro] profile that serves therefore to the challenges as the [cuentos]
At achieve the level higher the driver is to open several for beginning by the prosecution and [acabando] with funds to the profile
At same time there [conectada] a role [Autolog] in line that it [vuestros] results with the of other players and [disponibiliza] other duties Community
One of the elements more difficult of understand is how is nation the last career in the history
With the car [llegáis] to the tunnel of metre ( pass ) where you [ponéis] to to to shameful by the to ( pass )
The [velocímetro] you mark between 150 and 200 km / at ( pass ) and of suddenly by behind you is the [convoy] of metre and is you has by front without more
In the significant surely we a discussion on this for several days on if for the programming of at none was even a little or if the authors of truth us take by a bunch of [bobos]
The part technical the at not is nothing so but the least the effects [visuales] general are in the most of the cases [agradables] to times to [soberbios]
Well what worth that in the at more [tensos] is reduces the quality of image and in times of a way serious
This affects on all to the accidents where there [involucrados] many participants when the quality of image continual already not is valid
The audio is well and the bandwidth [sonora] is a question of tastes
to end of that be the welcome to the greater part the group youth the bandwidth [sonora] belongs to the category &apos; each one of their father and of their mother &apos; but is can mean that nobody well-informed the at only by their music
The that end of [Need] for [Speed] : The [Run] is therefore quite confused
If the at [evitase] errors absolutely thinks us we problems in that that The [Run] is the best at of [NFS] of the last years
are the that of that the at not is completed
The [diversión] is [asegurada] but [preparaos] because the errors you slap in the eyes with the force of a [reflectores] of airport

&apos; [Durará] five six years before of that the situation is [estabilice] a little is [calme] and the new players is [acostumbren] to their new papers &apos; so began with conviction their conference in the struck of law the her Czech to the EU [Milena] [Vicenová]
How not factored in seriously their slogan &apos; clear and openly on Europe &apos; that said already in the first part of their conference when managed under each body of the EU and their relations with such precise and clarity therefore would the [envidia] of many lecturers of the struck of law of the [U] [Carolina]
[Vicenová] also [ponderó] the work of the new President permanent of Council European [Herman] will Rompuy :
&apos; What first emerge the criticism that if is [insulso] a official grey capable of in any role but I of say that with to all is because moderating their gender to the mastered &apos;
&apos; is a man that know listen to the Member of the 27 states communicate with them and that has a vision [clarísima] of towards where must go the EU &apos;
The new since of representative of the Policy External and Security is explains to from of the question : &apos; it Who is this EU it to what number I [llamarla] &apos; It is therefore of a step important towards the unification and the clarification of of the union policy of face to States as China or India
Nobody to [prohibirnos] the cheese of [Olomouc]
[Vicenová] is has occupied also of the agenda was still and will the Council European in the future next
The presidency Czech of ago two years was a success
The Czech is Dublin of the crisis economic shining worked the crisis of gas and organised a summit to the Partnership Eastern
The fall the government in time time is lighthouse as a aspect very negative that back seriously to keeping
The representation Czech in the EU has by the time many commitments
In words of the her : &apos; a good mighty &apos; not only the presidency but also the crisis financial that is is trying now
is other hand there that approve the budget to seven years of the EU caused by the current situation economic a more very
If the budget is more simple and effective it what sectors will priority what countries will greater support and what least That is something that will present in the agenda of the next meeting
The her reminded also their [lemas] main with the that came to Europe : &apos; [Acerca] of Europe with clarity &apos;
&apos; What true is that not I them the [abreviaciones] [feas] the [extranjerismos] or the [jergas] that the people not understand &apos;
&apos; it How can a citizen understand that in Brussels not is invent of truth the curvature the curvature [curvos] or [redondos] bananas of various sizes or that nobody us is to ban the cheese of [Olomouc] &apos;
also intended from more from the environment of the EU and closer to more citizens Czech to the institutions European
We expected the Europe of the part
According the her the Czech have reputation of eurosceptics and the people is more well the aspects negative that the positive
In [lamentó] the low participation of the Czech in the institutions European
The fault is of a of factors as the [modestia] of our candidates their inability to write messages of motivation but also the little support of the Czech
In of success of the presidency Czech it of highlighted the force and the cooperation the group of [Visegrad]
&apos; [Créanme] that when who to me a Polish and a Hungarian and is I about a Slovak a French to my hand I says : &apos; it What already away been the the group of [Visegrad] &apos; and is is that not to ago any grace &apos;
In the future to the EU according [Vicenová] to [aguardan] new regulations [durísimas] of policy budgetary to the States Member
It is as something very real of concept of the two multi-speed if not are more in Europe more that the new of &apos; the Federation European &apos;
&apos; We countries in the [Eurozona] and countries outside of the [Eurozona] &apos;
&apos; We the space Schengen and have also the procedure of cooperation from &apos;
&apos; It said by first time that only [cooperen] the countries that want and the that not that is that outside &apos;
&apos; These procedures will each time more and reinforced the Europe of the two multi-speed &apos; is expected [Vicenová]
In this sense also skills the role of keeping and of [Herman] will Rompuy in the implementation the principle according the which all the subjects that affect to the whole of the EU is must discuss between the states Member not only between the Member of the [Eurozona]
[Brand] [story] :
The innovative [IBM] as their second century of existence
If someone [buscase] a term that [definiese] with great precise the strategy of [IBM] the more shorter would &apos; long term &apos;
For the public general [IBM] is the symbol of a revolution technological a company that is is as current and without However already have so hundred years since their foundation
The basis of this nature [largoplacista] the it the first head of the signing the resolute Greek J addressing Mr
already he coined the slogan of that many problems the world have solution if the people is ready to think
Their slogan &apos; [Think] ! &apos; is became in their you in about the which is finally pursuing the life of future heralded ( was also the title of a magazine internal that [IBM] began to publish in [1935] )
addressing was also the basis of a culture of company with [levantada]
&apos; For us [IBM] means a thinking to long term a movement continuous in direction the future
[IBM] has [sobrevivido] and been during hundred years by that reason because is remained faithful to their principles as but without would to the changes around
That us has allowed for our first century into the technology the business and the society
We - still more in our second century &apos; said during their anniversary the current director of the company [Samuel] J [Palmisano]
A system [sofisticado]
addressing already in the years 30 is [preocupó] the care of their employees as the his of [Baťa] in keeping ( the employees of [IBM] were of the first workforce Americans that [gozaron] of holiday [pagadas] sure uniform elegant and a [sofisticado] system of remains that [premiaba] to the best [inventores] and sellers
The same [sofisticación] to long term the maintained [IBM] in the relationship with the client
already from the principle the company was be [talentos] ( the be a of the first companies world in end with any kind of discrimination could choose without problems )
In the line of the strategy Anti-discrimination is the plan current of [IBM] by the that to [Palmisano] what [sustituirá] the year that next a woman : Virginia [Rometty]
She already has working 30 years in [IBM] where has been head of sales [márquetin] and strategies
During the last years [IBM] has participated of the called events lot rain of ideas in line of the that emerge redesign of future strategies and bringing
not is of stunning that [sobren] ideas therefore in the signing working almost a million of people
A institution with good ensure
The position set in the business provided to the company a image internal and external strong
&apos; Since the principle [IBM] remained a concept of institution more that of company technological &apos; says the economist teacher of the Harvard &apos; [School] and [autora] the book on [IBM] [Rosabeth] [Moss] [Kanter]
&apos; [IBM] not is a company technological but a company that is resolve problems of business for users of the technology &apos; [puntualiza] Orwell [Colony] of the [consultora] Forrester Research
As the own company says is a difference between into in the business and create directly a business
[IBM] - or the &apos; Britain Green &apos; - as is the known in the US US [familiarmente] to cause of their logo is has become in the last hundred years in a of the over companies of world
is possibly the company technological more [versátil] ( develops therefore equipment as programmes infrastructure and services it website within of a wider range of services that will from humble to [nanotecnología] )
[Ostenta] the greater number of patent of all the companies [tecnológicas] faith and five of their employees have received the was Prize
Among their [inventos] is are the cash cash the cards of payment the [permutas] financial the codes of bars and the [disquetes]
[IBM] [facturará] this year 220 billion million of dollars This year is has become in the second signing technological by coverage of market ( the first is [Apple] ) when overtook by first time in 1996 to Microsoft
[Mirando] the future
not all the products and bringing just of satisfy the will of the customers and the time ( [IBM] not [apostó] by their own system operational [OS] / 2 services in line [Prodigy] or computers [IBM] [PCjr] )
&apos; If their business is on in move not can [anclarse] responding in the last &apos; extended [Samuel] J [Palmisano]
is that [IBM] not has problems in build their foundation in other platforms ( and also if not work the or )
And this the difference of the competition Microsoft that basically is maintained and is always exclusively with Windows
Technology of future
In question of sales [IBM] is he on all to services of the that approximately a fifth part are of programmes and other fifth of equipment
With all still in 1990 the teams represented more of the half of the share of the suppliers
to from the year 2000 [IBM] has sold active of under performance by a value total of 15 billion million of dollars During in the same period has made 58 billion million of dollars in the buying of technology of future
The investments have followed from 2008 when by first time is manifested the modern crisis financial world
[IBM] acts according the premises of their first head Greek J addressing who for the great crisis economic of 29 increased the investments
It that to now the company [IBM] has known [capear] the crisis
The value of the actions of [IBM] from the beginning the year 2008 has grown [estratosféricamente] to a 120 % the benefit net of the company not has longer of increase
The motto of [IBM] is amended all unless their value
It can therefore wait that when missed the next crisis this heralded flexible [aguantará]
history of [IBM] : since the [cortadora] of meats to the flights space
The company [IBM] ( International &apos; [Machines] ) is founded in New York ago hundred years being their name original [Computing] [Tabulating] [Recording] [Corporation]
The name [IBM] is which already in the year [1924] - [originalmente] is was of a mark used in the [sucursales] of Canada and America of South
The basis that was place the birth of [IBM] arises of the merger of four companies that is extend to the the of [1880]
[Poseía] [inventos] as the famous &apos; clock of [fichar] &apos; that allows control the entry and exit of the employees
The architect of the new company was the man of business Charles [Ranlett] [Flint] who to [1930] also which their board [supervisor]
[Flint] [fichó] the head of a company of the competition Greek J addressing to that what [ayudase] with the management of the company
The new leader [eclipsó] the founder of [IBM] ( the ideas of addressing still being the basis firm on the that is [sustentan] the culture and identity [corporativas] )
addressing house-building the company to the year &quot;
[IBM] such as points their name began with the production and sale of all kind of equipment to business since [cortadores] of meat and cheese to boxes tills
During the four first years that addressing house-building the company the charging is [duplicó] in 9 million of dollars and began the great expansion of the company by the continents
addressing was so crucial to the company that almost after as years may the wheelchair the head was potential by their son Greek addressing [Junior]
Under their direction [IBM] began to work in the development of the intelligence artificial and developed the first language of programming
In the years 60 the personal and the computers of [IBM] [ayudaron] to the NASA to [guiar] the flights the space ( to [Mercurio] rings and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon )
Meanwhile therefore in 1964 [IBM] developed the first generation of computers the series [IBM] [System] / 360
The [clásicos] &apos; [pecés] &apos; that [instauraron] the standard of computers of time time came the market with the name of [IBM] [5150] in 1981
Twenty years after [IBM] miscalculations their production of computers to the company Chinese [Lenovo] the which by their part gained the part of evaluate of the company [Pricewaterhouse] [Coopers] and began to offer a completely advice and services of high value added
The strategy that has paid [IBM] these three last years is the concept [Smarter] [Planet] is say &apos; a planet more intelligent &apos;
Their aim is do a use more save of the technology but still not is have planned the areas or is has just the circumstances by example in what concerning the transport and the administration of cities
For the sector of trade [IBM] presented not ago a the platform &apos; [Smart] [Commerce] &apos; that allows to the retailers manage the cycle trade completely
[IBM] has a long history in this country
already in dissolved was a branch in the Czechoslovakia of then the first country that the had in the Europe Central and Eastern
Today here the [IBM] [ČR] operates also the centre strategic of [externalización] in [Brno]
The based for Europe Central and Eastern has is in Prague also here there a team of research of reputation world that working with the recognition of voice

The worst devil of the women : it also is refer to you
If [pedís] to the men that are able of quote some devil classic of the women in general each one of them the [nombrará] without think
[Queridas] women it you [reconocéis] in the lines following where is [citan] certain devil [femeninos] that obtaining do [hervir] the blood to the affected

Some women is are account that should appease their [pasión] by the purchases by what least a little
But to see it what woman could [resistir] the temptation of wander without more by the shops of clothes to [prendas] well [ajustadas] and after [probárselas] all in the [probador] ( [idealmente] in all colours different )

The sex strong also is of agreement in that As more is the often of the complaints more [molestas] is them the women

The women is [concentran] in the relations by that them like about Money of things the kind who where with who how and by what
to what better to each a of source to times is to [escapa] a small and [inofensivo] [chisme]
With the hand in the heart this is own of almost all the women

[Matt] [Read] not allowed more complications but ended overcome in number of two against one
&apos; [Pronger] had a good action in our field &apos;
&apos; [Despejó] the [disco] I I at and [Read] is was towards the part more [alejada] &apos;
&apos; [Traté] of [atinarle] the [disco] and am with because what [conseguí] &apos; [describía] [Voráček] the last [gol] of party such as what lived
With their victory [Philadelphia] is has since in head of the Conference This
The of Czech of Montreal [Jaroslav] [Špaček] not rugby to the end the party against [Buffalo] in the second third is - by a minor in the part higher the body
The [Canadiens] not only lost a player with very experience in defence but also by a difference of two goals 2 : 3

than that the points recovered the you local [lamentó] the great amount of [lesionados] in the last class and playing the party only with five have
&apos; That is There &apos;
&apos; [Jugamos] the party only with a player contractor the rest were [noveles] &apos;
&apos; In end but is that against that not is can do nothing have that [lidiar] with this &apos; said Jacques Martin
&apos; Both [rotar] to the players is the against us not what we [resistir] &apos;
&apos; We that simplify more still the at from the [disco] of our field &apos;
&apos; And so stop missed &apos; he one of the have [P] K [Subban]
The [portero] [Ondřej] [Pavelec] played with 30 speeches of [Winnipeg] in the victory of 5 : 2 on the [Tampa] [Bay]
The goals of [Jets] were liberties by five players that put so end to a series of [derrotas] that already [duraban] five parties
How have which the prices of the travel from 1989
far 1989 had in the Czechoslovakia of then only five agencies of travel state get : [Čedok] [Sporturist] [CKM] [Rekrea] and [Autoturist]
The agencies of travel of time time [vendían] in the most of the cases travel only the bloc socialist therefore the travel to West were very [restringidos]
The tourists Czech would by therefore of holiday to the beaches of the sprinkler ( Republic Democratic German ) to the Union Soviet ( [Sochi] in [Crimea] in the Sea Black ) to Bulgaria and Romania ( both in the Sea Black ) and to Hungary ( [Balaton] )
A exception positive was the period for between 1962 and Programmes when is could travel to Yugoslavia without However after the regime [yugoslavo] is [inclinó] towards the dressed and the travel of the tourists Czech were then quite [restringidos]
A great - of socialism was the fact that to the citizens the bloc socialist ( or be also to the [Checoeslovacos] ) not is them [permitiese] travel free and processing or even by the countries socialists
If a citizen wanted travel processing by example to Poland or to the Union Soviet needed a letter of invitation if not the journey individual not was possible
The agencies of journey [ofrecían] in those times also travel the West but one is should to to the EU with a together of ball and to so whole the night or have &apos; good known &apos; in the agency
yet so not all was cattle
The so-called &apos; promise of change &apos; that was the condition for the travel the West not is [concedía] to the &apos; people politically little reliable &apos; that so not could travel in all
The currency [checoslovaca] not was a currency freely converted and without guarantee of change not was possible obtain the resources ( the currency Western ) to travel to West
The great majority of the Czech experience their holiday in their own country by what that had a great number of infestation and houses of summer that the Czech [adquirían] This preparation still there
The way of travel of the Czech has suffered from 1989 a real revolution
While that to 1989 to us was the not is more to the holiday in the sprinkler or Bulgaria the year last the Czech did 4 5 million of travel of holiday to countries of all the world
is [nna] great - of the that today day already not are aware the fact of that the destination currently odds-on Croatia to 1989 not is could travel freely because was part of the Yugoslavia of then
to principles of the years 90 is imposed the exemption of visa to travel to the States neighbours of Europe Western what that resulted a wave huge of visits of shorter long-term [sobretodo] to Vienna or Germany
The [checoeslovacos] for a time not is his [hartos] of the [excursiones] the West all the world wanted see the what least by a time
is example in Paris [dormían] the groups of Czech in the parks in shops of campaign already that our income of then not us [permitían] pay a hotel or pension
A feature typical of the Czech of time time was the be for the food ( tomatoes pressed etc ) for save
Another time important was the introduction of the [convertibilidad] of the nickel Czech so our tourists could finally after of decades buy freely currency Western
Our level of life [aumentaba] and with him also the wages means what that around of 1997 resulted a increase in the demand of travel
With the increase of the demand of travel they the agencies to from of 1997 with regularly to preparation the travel using the Also of flights [chárter] what that was down incredibly the prices of the travel in compared with the last thanks to the possibility of obtain respondents by the volume of passengers
to end of the 90 the century last already the Czech found without visa to almost all the countries developed exception US US what which [simplificó] still more our travel
Another time interesting in the history of tourism [pos-revolucionario] happened already in the 2000 when was organised thanks to a huge demand the first flight direct from keeping to a country [exótico] and was to Thailand
Since time year proceed all the years flights [chárter] direct with tourists Czech was countries distant and [calurosos] This winter already is [volará] directly from keeping to 12 destinations [exóticos]
The countries [exóticos] the their currently close of 100 billion Czech the year
Another time interesting of this time that symbolises our development [pos-revolucionario] came in the year 2008
The 17 of November of 2008 US US squeezed the visa to the tourists Czech with what that our country happened to be between the countries more developed the world
In 2008 the Czech by first time in their history have last more of the half of their holiday in the abroad ( 50 3 % ) and by first time in their history is have spent in travel the abroad more of 15 billion billion Czech by head including the expenses in the website of stay
[Convocada] House General [Ordinaria] to choose the President that could end of new in point died
Since ago almost five months the football Czech is without President and is likely that the successor of Safronov [Hašek] as President of the Federation Czech of [Futbol] ( [FAČR] ) not is [conocerá] or after the call of the next House General [Extraordinaria] that will place this Thursday in [Nymburk]
In fact still not is has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to to
However the same not is will vote even to choose between the three candidates
The interested to [presidir] the football Czech are [Jindřich] [Rajchl] [Miroslav] [Pelta] and [Tomáš] [Paclík]
[Hašek] [renunció] to their office in June not without before rectify to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that [supiese] deals of football in the future
However However after of conclude the was [Hašek] is used a controversy between the two [federaciones] of the partnership unable of to to a agreement to decisions a candidate common
This became in obvious the 16 of September when had that be elected the new President
The naturally of the House General is met in vain in the House National ( [Národní] [dům] ) on in the area [praguense] of [Smíchov] because the discussions is had blocked and not only in As the method of election
not is came to no consensus or in As to who in the House General had right to vote - only the representatives legal or also the naturally with non-citizen powers
to from of this time and because to this only point is in a agreement - supported also by the recommendation the Institute of state and law according the which the representation by non-citizen powers not is possible
However However the disputes on the code electoral still open
than light on the situation already not could throw or the Committee Executive that in their meetings [ordinarias] or extraordinary basically not Vihear nothing
The opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of times already but the point nerve still being the same
The question is the next : it of what way proceed in the third round to avoid the point died
&apos; The dispute revolves in about to if is must proceed of agreement with the [estatutos] or find other model &apos; says [Dušan] [Svoboda] one of the three [vicepresidentes] of the [FAČR] that from the direction of the partnership represents the [futbol] professional
According the model proposed in the [estatutos] in the third round going time candidate that have greater percentage of support in the federation to the which will their candidacy
The Region of Moravia is ready to to to a compromise to that can win time candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both [federaciones]
The part [bohemia] without However which the condition of that the winner according these are [porcentuales] should have the most of the least two thirds
&apos; This to [quitaría] without However the sense to the two rounds previous and [negaría] by completely the concept of system [bicameral] &apos; so is as [Svoboda] understand the concerns of the part [morava] according what which what better would not play the order and vote according the [estatutos] persons
With what said surprisingly is of agreement also [Tomaš] [Paclík] but is is that the regulation electoral established by the [estatutos] of all the candidates appropriate more to [Pelta]
&apos; I like that is [votara] the maximum of agreement with the [estatutos] &apos;
&apos; For that not is [inventen] any [tontería] about of the representatives as in the last House General &apos; says the you of Victoria [Plzen] that is [postula] by first time as candidate and that at their comments mainly in against of [Pelta]
[Pelta] still being positive
According he in [Nymburk] is decide on the new President and he believes that the candidates in the future [cooperaran] of way served
&apos; All the [pasiones] is [apaciguarán] with the party of today of our team national in the [Campeonato] European
&apos; The football will to be leading and so is [cooperara] more to will &apos; says the representative the [Jablonice] that of the three candidates has more experience in management of football therefore to level professional as regional
[Rajchl] is the more reluctant
&apos; hope that is it to a agreement but by Unfortunately the situation is a more very &apos;
&apos; not is is the conflict between [bohemios] and [moravos] but there attempts of [ajustar] the rules to their own convenience &apos;
&apos; This can have as result a new deadlock of the House General &apos;
&apos; In all case hope that is band the sense common &apos; said [Rajchl]
already not is a time for that all the parties shall to a agreement
Some negotiations had that take in Montenegro but it who can know to that start the party if the team of football will completely
The on special in the that had that travel to [Podgorica] between other the [vicepresidentes] [Dalibor] [Kucera] and [Rajchl] not has out this morning by problems technical in Prague taking that other a alternative to carry to part the committee executive the place where will place the party of classification
[Quizas] the meeting decisive by end could be the that will place to level ministerial that according have is will this Wednesday
to [Josef] [Dobeš] minister of Education Youth and [Deportes] to like a integrate to the parties divided to the organisation integrating more powerful the country for that is it to a agreement
There a in at : the benefits state the credibility the football and also the next House General of Committee central of the federation [checoslovaca] of sport ( [ČSTV] ) that awareness made of a new direction the sport Czech after the problems financial of the home of [loterías] [Sazka]
[Paclík] [luchará] by achieve the presidency because not is a candidate more appropriate
If the head of the [futbolistas] of [Pilsen] [Tomaš] [Paclik] before of the House General extraordinary [conociera] the name of a candidate appropriate that [satisficiese] all their ideas on the new President of the Federation Czech of [Fútbol] ( [FAČR] ) or is would as candidate to a since so relevant
&apos; If would a person appropriate be fighting by it and not I would as candidate to the elections &apos;
&apos; But to the day of today not is has been find a person so &apos; said [Paclík] to the Agency of [Noticias] Czech ( [ČTK] )
What that justifies to [Paclík] to into in the challenge with [Miroslav] [Pelta] and [Henry] [Rajchl] is exactly the possibility of block to [Pelta] the course winner of the elections that opens the way to the presidency of the Federation Czech of [Futbol] ( [FAČR] )
[Paclík] also [puntualiza] that in case through [permanecería] in the office of President only to 2013 when long-overdue the time of the assembly general ordinary
In that office to would see to a expert and good workforce that not is too related with the events fans
&apos; already I about with some people to the that could have in account &apos;
&apos; For me was a madness hear to some say that in this time or even want identify with the football Czech &apos;
&apos; I would change that vision &apos; adds
What that supposed more bother to [Paclík] in this time is the relationship of [Pelta] with the President of the Partnership of [Fútbol] Regional of [Pilsen] Polanski [Berbr] a man with a last controversial known outside of [mundillo] as a [poderoso] [lobista] with ability of influence in the vote of the naturally in the assembly general
For [Paclík] is so unacceptable see to [Pelta] at in the [sillón] presidential
&apos; In case of that [gane] is keeping the status existing and nothing in the football will &apos;
&apos; With the support of [Berbra] a man of business ambitious the football sorry still least from &apos; said [Paclík]
[Menciona] also the fact of that ago a years the name of [Pelta] was e-commerce with a usual telephone for the research of a case of corruption of the which [Pelta] went [impune]
&apos; not know what prestige the football could bring the victory of [Pelta] &apos;
&apos; And with what eyes us plead the UEFA and the FIFA &apos; said [Paclík] that also decision-making with certain caution their declaration previous that &apos; [vendería] the Club [Pilsen] if [Pelta] is become in President &apos;
In the case of win the elections of Thursday [Paclík] could be the cooperation with [Pelta] in the future
In same opinion is the other candidate [Rajchl] that has been supported by [Paclík] before of the House General of September that end in a [fiasco]
&apos; He ( [Pelta] ) be the first the that solitary &apos;
&apos; is very able &apos;
&apos; I what could imagine by example as head of the representation &apos;
&apos; but not as workforce of a partnership &apos;
&apos; I not [meto] the [narices] there where not I I capable &apos; added [Paclík] that in September [suscitó] very attention by support the from of the Commission of [Árbitros] [presidida] by [Ludek] [Macel] potential after by [Dagmar] [Damkova]
[Paclík] The that is [atrevería] to manage the partnership
[Recurre] to their capacities of management of the companies private therefore from the summer last is also the Director-General of [Pilsen] that with their support took in May the [triunfo] in first division
&apos; I force to change some things in the area of football and make to their practice safe &apos;
&apos; For reduce the influence of some groups of pressure that probably tend to influence in the decisions of committee refunded and of appeal have situations unpleasant said [Paclík] without so their [antipatías] towards the President of [Sparta] Daniel [Křetínský]
A of the priorities also be the of consolidate the relationship between the [FAČR] and the Committee [Olímpico] [Checo] with the aid of which [ejercía] pressure on the leaders political to that pockets more money the sport of the tax of the I
&apos; is one of the problems key the that is should conducting the new President &apos;
&apos; If [aumentaran] the tax on the games of gambling as what [anuncian] the parties political support their arguments but tirade have that tell where is to stop all this money &apos; out
[Ademas] [Paclík] now not has in account even their partnership with the Club [Pilsner] but he same says that the President of the [FAČR] must be &apos; not an &apos;
[Pelta] is to their time e-commerce with [Jablonec] and [Rajchl] with [Dukla] of Prague
&apos; not is ideal &apos;
&apos; But not see sense the fact of yield preach my actions of Club of [Pilsen] to other person to then again there after a year and a &apos; said [Paclík]
[Pelta] promised to the [FAČR] new [estatutos] that [acabarían] with the point died of the elections
Two days before of the House General of the Partnership of [Fútbol] one of the candidates to the presidency [Miroslav] [Pelt] promised that in case of be elected Coordinating that the [FAČR] had a new [estatutos] that [sirvieran] definitively for right in the future the controversy in As the regulation election
The representative of [Jablonec] is positive in As to the meeting of this Thursday in [Nymburk] and believes that the conflict [preelectoral] could move towards a solution today with the possible victory the team of football
already before of the elections not made in September [Pelta] promised Firstly in case of be elected precisely in the representation and in tax-raising funds
[Decidió] participate in the last minute in the last assembly general by what that this postponing of two months to could go well to defend and to in a context more broader their ideas on the management of football
&apos; The people of all the levels is as the football already ago a time and expected know this Thursday the new President &apos;
&apos; [Sienten] that has come the time of that someone [gestione] the partnership &apos; think the man that is couples mainly with the Club of [Jablonice] but that worked in the [Sparta] and in the committee executive of the Partnership
is this reason believes have enough experience to manage the football Czech
is convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that hung in the time of Safronov [Hašek]
&apos; Unfortunately in the House general of June were adopted the [estatutos] that not were so planned as all thought &apos;
&apos; If [excluimos] certain interpretations we a President already since September &apos; emergency [Pelta]
exact the [readaptación] the document more important of the Partnership [Cívica] is [usó] as [señuelo] to who to the naturally
&apos; If I [eligen] President I what counts as a challenge staff and am prepared to respond in case of that this [falle] &apos;
&apos; is a question of principles without the which not we There &apos; says [Pelta]
In in theory is not over with their opponents
already in the last had your that is was mercy with [Henry] [Rajchl] the that respects by their training in law being aware of that their [oponente] be also their first Vice-President
already was a time without attack to Greek [Paclík] who the contrary of [Pelta] not with pawn with head
&apos; a more of a year in the world of football and already has achieved some successes &apos;
&apos; Their attacks but were [vergonzosos] and very people became amazed by the campaign electoral &apos;
&apos; is that many of them [dudan] on their real nature &apos; said to their opponent [Pelta] that still being faithful to the statements announced already in September
Their weapon more powerful is according him their knowledge of football since the &apos; more in to the with
This last should be [escaparate] of promotion of football
&apos; also [intentaría] right all the [escándalos] that overview to cause of the [Bohemians] as result the scandal of corruption the year last &apos;
&apos; immediately after I [involucraría] in the negotiations with the sector public and the private to ensure that has enough money for all the football &apos; said ago two months to the [ČTK] the candidate of 46 years
to continuation also promised that their Members as President of football not [comportaría] no change staff of the [plantilla]
&apos; should that know first the tasks of every he &apos; said wave to [Strahov] where after a long period of [anarquía] has a [nerviosismo] comprehensible
to despite of the scenarios at current that is [vaticinan] to the next assembly general he believes that the naturally not travel in vain this Thursday to [Nymburk]
&apos; If the only point of disagreement be how vote in the third round without doubt what we overcome
&apos; The football needs credibility the which is will only if by end has a leader &apos; still two days before of the &apos; more decisive in their career of representative [Pelta] still being positive
[Rajchl] enforce that under their leadership the [FAČR] [empezaría] to work with wish
If in the quarter House General its elected the current Vice-President [Jindrich] [Rajchl] as new President of the Partnership of [Fútbol] Czech very people is remuneration surely [resentida]
[Rajchl] enforce that in case of be elected is [trabajaría] hard
It implement a change systematic and do that the Member of committee executive are for of each area of football processing
also is compromises to resolve the case of the [Bohemians] improve the relations with the UEFA and the FIFA get more money to the football and continue with the work on by the previous President Safronov [Hašek]
&apos; As President I would commit by completely the football &apos;
&apos; Since the contacts international with the UEFA and the FIFA to the selection happening by the football professional or the Invariably of young [futbolistas] of high performance &apos;
&apos; With this not I say that what would all only &apos; said [Rajchl] in a interview to the [ČTK]
&apos; am a player of team and I destroy the powers the committee executive of such way that each Member can their to a area consolidated &apos;
&apos; And [asignaré] tasks difficult for that the football can in each one of these [segmentos] to forward with a momentum &apos;
&apos; to very people this probably not to [gustará] because busies start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the others &apos; added
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement [futbolístico] is says that has have the possibility of not stand of new as candidate
&apos; all know that work 20 hours joys &apos;
&apos; But need know that this will sense and that not will people behind of my that I – and [obstaculizará] to every step &apos; he so the reasons of their [indecisión]
&apos; Many people I has said that not I asked by zero because then is Fico by [vencidos] also the others &apos;
&apos; It is of have faith for not leave so without more &apos; said
According say to justifies also continue the work that already began with [Hašek]
&apos; During these two years is end a great part the work that not I that now is vanish &apos;
&apos; There processes that is had started and that have their effect within of a couple of years and not I would that someone the [pare] &apos; announced concerned by the fact of that if [eligieran] the other candidate [Miroslav] [Pelta] the situation in the partnership could again to be such as was before of the time of [Hašek]
&apos; I I in the order and is something that in my opinion [Mirek] [Pelta] not is able of keep
&apos; conceals of him is on all whole that people that is [ocuparía] of football for that outside only a privileged to a few elected &apos;
&apos; It I can [reprochar] a lot of things but not the fact of that am to favour of someone &apos;
&apos; defend be aim &apos;
&apos; I do a football for all because only so is [sentirán] well all and not only the elected &apos; said [Rajchl]
rejects also the idea that only serious Karlsbad the President
&apos; Although some people seeking that what contrary I in mind do what maximum by Moravia &apos;
&apos; is example is time of think in the fact of destroy the second division in a part Czech and in other [morava] whose winners [irían] to the first division &apos;
&apos; not is would the situation current in the that have only three teams of Moravia what that represents a problem to the players [moravos] young &apos; said [Rajchl]
Although to the [pugna] of the elections presidential is [sumó] [Tomaš] [Paclík] President of Club [Pilsner] [Rajchl] not is of believe in their for of be elected
&apos; still I have a strong support of the Federation Czech the which I made as their Vice-President and that know that behind of me there successes clear &apos; said [Rajchl] whose successes understand the savings of a tens of million of billion of contracts [desventajosos] the negotiations of contracts [televisivos] and the negotiations on the law of the I
is other hand recognised their part of fault in that the federation not is united
And while civilized that [Pelta] is &apos; [descalificado] to to the confidence in the football Czech &apos; as the other rival [Paclík] as a candidate strong that itself has something that offer the football
&apos; Nobody can is that was a great work by the [Pilsen] time year &apos;
&apos; In the case of that be elected probably will what that already began Safronov [Hašek] and not [cambiaria] of way significantly the [plantilla] the staff in the soothe &apos;
&apos; not I use that to my favour &apos; [evalúa] so to their rival [Rajchl]

A history of architecture with ups and a end happy the an of the statement universal Austrian of Brussels of 1958 successful prizes was in Vienna for a museum is became gap and is [desmoronó]
now is [reabre] as home of holiday
The architecture of [postgerra] modern [apasiona] the forms clear the [halls] of glass the [curvas] [valientes] and the new materials of construction classic of thinking on the progress technical for what that the an [austriaco] the architect Order [Schwanzer] to the statement universal of Brussels of 1958 is a example appropriate and known
The [Pabellón] of [Schwanzer] successful then the Cardiff [Prix] of [Arquitectura] by their there and floating construction of steel and glass
The construction is as to the currently a milestone contemporary of the architecture
thrive the architect so known that also was the an of Austria in the next statement universal
With their [legendaria] tower of four [cilindros] for [MBW] more the building [adyacente] [aplanado] in [Munich] happened to be globally known
Their an designed as a construction temporary for holiday is [levantó] after of the statement universal in the [Schweizer] [Garten] together to the station of southern of Vienna is [reformó] in 1962 and within is kind a museum of century 20 is phoned the &apos; home 20 &apos;
The building was appropriate but [carecía] of the areas and technology We for a museum ; without any wall for [colgar] art or a good environment
to despite of this is used to that the art contemporary in Vienna had a new home
The building is gap since 2001 and [decae] each time more
currently the architect Adolf [Krischanitz] [reformó] the an now what way &apos; home 21 &apos; and is [usará] in the future as museum of art contemporary
The Tuesday by the later is kind the museum [belvedere] the that belongs the home with the first statement a coup of at in true way
[Agnes] [Husslein-Arco] the new there of the gallery [belvedere] Austrian since 2007 in a new start
[Husslein-Arco] [doctora] in history of art with a considerable career between other things [patinadora] artistic on ice in their young more later in [Sotheby] the museum [Guggenheim] and there [fundadora] the museum of art modern of [Salzburgo] was the reforms with the insistence of political and protectors of the monuments [proporcionó] funds public and [patrocinadores] private and set their use
to exception of art contemporary is psychologically the works of [escultor] [Fritz] [Wotruba] of the foundation [homónima] should have a cafeteria and a [librería] and also built a building of offices
Audit narrower budget under
[Krischanitz] was the better election for do
not only because [reformó] of way sensitive the [secesión] of Wresinski [Olbrichs] in Vienna what [amplió] and is to [adjudicó] the Song if not because [estudió] with [Schwanzwer] in the University Technical of Vienna and the an was to him a &apos; place important and vast &apos; in the that [contemplaba] &apos; almost all the purposes of week &apos; the holiday
[Conocía] the project and the problem the building that with with their low-cost to Vienna in their change of use with generosity and easily
In the reforms current there large problems the building was &apos; a [devorador] of energy &apos; said [Krischanitz]
It changed the profile of the windows of the lofty of glass is [instaló] a glass [aislante] reinforced with very of glass and is [remplazó] the homeless of glass by a glass of safety special
The bridges [térmicos] and the [vigas] of steel is [reforzaron] or [remplazaron] and the ceilings of [amianto] is [rehabilitaron]
Two pictures is [emplearon] to the new use a panel of light fallen between the home and the street provided the [iluminación] a bridge serves to into the building almost new but still the an of [Schwanzer]
cells the doors external original the home is [pintada] in subscribe old [caoba] and [protegida] against the [oxidación]
And the room of cinema is exactly as was before
And all this with a control narrower by part of the office of monuments and a under budget
&apos; to often had that find material that outside good cheap and also did to the office of protection of monuments &apos; says [Krischanitz] and means of a soil [áspero] in the [sótano]
to despite of all the pressure problems and reforms the building is maintained flexible and plain
What of an &apos; that wine of Brussels &apos; has been difficult said ago little [Krischanitz] a typical &apos; emergence choice in the history of the city &apos;
A architecture so is &apos; always in the place wrong &apos; and by that wanted &apos; certainly the awareness appropriate &apos;
In this case the home 21 not is in the place wrong has happened a coup of at [urbanístico] The completely new and [planeado] &apos; area of the station central &apos; with housing and offices is is with the [Schweizer] [Garten]
And such time take other coup of at : The home 21 could receive a forward of other construction of [Krischanitz] therefore the [coleccionista] [Francesca] von Habsburg has purchased the room of art temporary [berlinesa] and as is as negotiate with the city on a place neighbour in the [Schweizer] [Garten]

After the discovery of &apos; the cell of [Zwickau] &apos; the media of media Turks [dudan] of state of right German
A newspaper about of a &apos; ideology bloody &apos; that again to [reavivarse]
The for of eight small employers noticed and who between the years 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right
In Turkey and in the population German of origin Turkish is has reacted with fear and concern to this news
For many Germans of origin Turkish which a [fantasma] that is [creía] died ago time from the attacks with way of fires in [Mölln] in November of 1992 and in [Solingen] in May of 1993 not had happened more episodes of violence with background of extreme right against Turks
not However never is has questioned that in Germany there xenophobia
The network [ultraderechista] 600 reveals a scale whose dimensions not were or a least [previsibles]
&apos; it [Vuelve] to [reavivarse] the ideology bloody &apos; [titula] the edition by Internet of newspaper Turkish &apos; [Haberturk] &apos;
The newspaper &apos; [Sabah] &apos; [resalta] by the contrary that one of the authors the crime was a – of the Office Federal of Defence of the Constitution and is shows concerned by that the authorities German can be involved in the [pantanal] [ultraderechista]
The community Turkish in Germany [reaccionó] with [sensatez] the end of week reminded to the victims of the violence racist with a [vigilia] to the [Puerta] of [Brandenburgo]
Two weeks before the community Turkish in Berlin together with the political Germans and Turks [reflexionaron] in a act formal of fifty anniversary of agreement [turco-alemán]
The them is it in scene with much colours as a history with end happy
The information came to some means Turks as a [bofetada] : &apos; The gift German by the fifty anniversary &apos; says the title of a Article in the platform Turkish of Internet &apos; sheet X &apos; wave the background of the chain of for
The emission German &apos; [Hürriyet] &apos; not should in out this connection mental
&apos; starts to smell is &apos; says the title of the spine of [Ahmet] [Külahci]
[Resalta] that the murdered were people that [pagaban] their tax and did a important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany
In the consolidating of Internet of Germans of [procedencia] Turkish the behaviour of the police and their both success in the [búsquedas] is Statute very self-criticism
The authors is [asombran] of that the authorities German not have [buscado] a before suspected in the proving of the [ultraderecha]
hinted is shows As least communications in As to the [drásticos] media : &apos; to from of now here is lose to the immigrants not them is more that the self-defence and the arms &apos;
&apos; This be the better [autoprotección] &apos;
&apos; The peace internal of Germany on are of the quality of the perverse and of the adequacy of the penalty to whole the network &apos; it &apos; [Selen] &apos;
What that means that if the peace internal of Germany is in danger the attacks of [Mölln] and [Solingen] is [aclararán] in 1990s years
The image of the ruins the fire of [Solingen] is has incident in the flash German and Turkish
No another skeletons was more clearly to the Turks that live here that there a threat concrete and to the Germans that the mistrust and the distance can [desembocar] in the violence
The attacks [agudizan] the sense of group of the part Turkish
not repeat the errors of last
In the press Turkish is reputed then mainly the uninhabitable of the policy German after the attacks [Helmut] [Kohl] is denies to visit to the survivors of [Mölln]
After the attack with way of fire of [Solingen] sent a [telegrama] of condolences the President Turkish and [Klaus] [Kinkel] their minister of Affairs Foreign what [sustituyó] in the [funeral] of Cologne [Kinkel] [detalló] in their speech what that contribute with the tax the Turks of Germany
remains clear how is estimated the value of a person according the amount of their tax
The information current of the means Turks again to show what thorough that is from then the mistrust of many Germans of origin Turkish in the legality of this country
In the effort of a explanation wider and of a [revaloración] the terrorism of extreme right in Germany this time do lack words [francas]
The bank the scandal of [lago] of [Zurich]
The bank more [arriesgado] of Europe not is is in Italy or France if not in Switzerland
The [UBS] almost it in [bancarrota] in the crisis financial and since then is [deslizó] of a crisis to the next
now the at a German
certain that [Axel] charisma not what had considered
After of their witnessed starting of the summit of bank federal in July is through that in 2013 [comenzaría] in a new and almost also of witnessed work : President of board administrative of great bank blessing [UBS] a [inesperado] and estimates step in their career
[Axel] charisma is am should commends Switzerland by their contest and to the [UBS] by their would acquired strength and is fall comments [amables] on their will colleagues
&apos; The flash has achieved a revival &apos;
&apos; I am cooperate with [Kaspar] [Villiger] and [Oswald] [Grübel] &apos;
In September became clear that all would completely different
A operators financial of the flash in London prevented all the systems of safety the bank and [defraudó] 1 7 billion million of EUR
[Oswald] [Grübel] director general of the flash a banker not only known in Switzerland had that come
The President of board administrative of the flash is was from then also [tocado] and all good : it will is [Axel] charisma
It through that charisma must advise the bank from February of 2012
And is will office of the presidency of board administrative in May not to principles of 2013 as the bank [comunicó] the Tuesday
This is hard for [Axel] charisma
not is banker more well a of economy and [consejero] and has had a period of adaptation surely necessary
In coup is ago for of the strategy of a bank that just of again to prove that deserves the title &apos; the greater bank the scandal of Europe &apos; since ago time
is a part the flash is huge to ago little was the greater administrator of goods global and by other part from ago years is [desliza] of a scandal the next
Nothing so what seems is to [ahorra] the changed so proud bank blessing
started the crisis financial
The flash had a reputation excellent to 2007
The image the administrator of goods blessing [discreto] and part but also [mañoso] is [combinó] with objectives ambitious also wanted be a great number in the banks of investments
is a part with 1 6 billion of dollars the flash variety more money of customers wealthiest that any other bank of world
And by other part [avanzó] as bank of investments in the league of the large banks of world
This [impresiona]
Hans [Geiger] the former banker and both a of [banca] in [Zurich] for many years explains : &apos; with my students always I described to the flash as model of a good bank &apos;
&apos; Since the point of view current one is question : it How could [equivocarme] &apos;
was in a great mistake
In the year 2007 went to the light that something went very is in the flash
to middle of year Peter [Wuffli] director general that to then was have as a banker [genial] and very intelligent resigned surprisingly
Some months after is [sospechó] the reason
The fund of investments the bank is [embarcó] in losses with titles of high risk and had that [amortizar] thousands of million
For shoulder with this the flash announced a [inyección] of capital of nothing least that of 13 billion million of FRF
For this found investors course that some [miraran] with contempt to little before : a fund state Asian and [opaco] of Singapore and a fund state Arab so [discreto] that never is had heard their name
This was only the first coup
In April of 2008 [empeoró]
The bank had that on the loss of thousands of million [Marcel] [Ospel] President of board administrative in 2006 in the second best paid board administrative of Switzerland resigned
In October of 2008 she the disaster in view of their investments wrong the [UBS] is found in the crisis financial to the costing and had that be [rescatada] by the state
The bank national [compró] values problem to the [UBS] by many thousands of million the Confederation [Helvética] was six thousands of million of FRF by a [bono] sensible converted by the that is [convertía] in [copropietaria] of bank
whole Switzerland was affected is said what dramatic that was this to a country small if [aloja] to banks so large
Finally the sum of balance of the [UBS] in 2007 was more of five times greater that the results economic of Switzerland ( see [gráfica] )
&apos; not we again to rescue to the [UBS] &apos; said [Geiger] expert in [banca]
to the first disaster is joined the second
Few months after the [UBS] [capituló] in a conflict tax with America and is was ready to limits the data of the customers wealthiest that possibly had [defraudado] tax with aid the bank
In whereby a figure of 780 thousands of million of dollars point of profits [injustificados] of these business with a compensation by payment
With this the [UBS] [confesó] more or least have helped in the fraud tax
[Simultáneamente] lost something that had been from always their capital in the competition by customers rich : the [aureola] of discretion
After the scandal the secret of bank blessing already not is the same
to this continued the - of President of the junta directive and of President of board administrative
And the emigration of the funds of the customers
In this way in few months the bank lost their credibility in their two sectors central : in the [banca] of investments by the speculation flawed and in the administration of goods by the aid the fraud tax
And fair when readjust to be something more relaxed fair when is I that the [UBS] readjust to this is this [desdichada] history the operators a operators individual [defraudó] 1 7 billion million of EUR before of that the bank is [diera] account of that something was is
And is [desveló] by what seen this still not works well with the management of risk in the [banca] of investments
&apos; With the case [Adoboli] is world that the controls of risk have changed too little &apos; says Martin [Janssen] a of economy and finance in the Institute [Bancario] of the University of [Zurich]
The director financial of a great bank German also is sure : &apos; The problem of the [UBS] is that not dominates the controls of risk &apos;
is what that about the idea of the caution with the that the bankers Swiss is made from ago time be the watch of the over goods of world : any risk too large in change the security of money to [quebrar] the other hand of the republic sanctity
The deposits of safety of the banks Swiss were the symbol of the reliability [inquebrantable] as [Lindt] and [Sprüngli] of chocolate genuine
The central of the [UBS] in [Zurich] not dovetails with the buzz of part bank private blessing only is a little greater
The situation is classical
The bank has their based main in the street [Bahnhofstraße] of [Zurich] that is from the station main directly the [lago] of [Zurich] [enmarcado] by the summits covered of snow of the mountains [suizas]
here the buildings are [ostentosos] the sells are a of the more higher of Europe
here is are [joyerías] as [Tiffany`s] between business traditional Swiss as the [confitería] [Sprüngli]
here reside since ago years the banks Swiss : from the bank national happening by the palace of [Credit] [Suisse] to the [elitarios] banks private as [Julius] [Bär]
It enter in the room of reception of the [UBS] by a disproportionately door chair
s the walls are [revestidas] of [mármol] front is are large [sillones] of such with the logo the bank there a great [letrero] to indicate the &apos; safety &apos;
The [UBS] know what that the client search here : Security
The two large banks Swiss the [UBS] and [Credit] [Suisse] in some time have [desplazado] the idea the great bank blessing or the have betrayed as view the President of a small bank private blessing
they not read their name in the newspaper the end and the out ago as all the bankers Swiss also with the business of both large banks
The [UBS] is has fact too large view mainly in the [banca] of investments where the penal have cattle ground
must the Swiss not had nothing more that say
&apos; And is have have for a time to the our of the penal &apos;
In fact the [UBS] changed the [banca] of investments with handed their first great proposed and then wine the disaster any entity financial European had lost therefore money in the [jungla] the high risk as the great bank blessing
The 15 of October of 2008 the disaster was clear
&apos; That Wednesday the coalition government the small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of their nation &apos; it the author [Lukas] [Hässig] in their book &apos; Wever [UBS-Crash] &apos; ( &apos; The [crash] of the [UBS] &apos; in Spanish )
The political granted to 68 thousands of million of FRF or approximately 45 thousands of million of EUR to save the great bank of the [bancarrota]
it How is them happens
It about with the bankers Swiss so are the problem in the dimension of the [UBS]
In June of 1998 two of the three large banks Swiss is [fusionan] in a [poderoso] consortium
[Surge] a bank that because to the merger was too large for the small Switzerland and still growing
is what that was for that the two different banks precursors of the [UBS] is [complementaran] : a bank wealthy but fifty-year with the centre of the administration of goods in [Zurich] and a [internacionalización] more poor but more strong
In suddenly the banks of investment [internacionalizados] came of way have with a money with the that could do [rodar] a great bicycle financial
There two names related with this takes of the [UBS] : Peter [Wuffli] head the consortium of the [UBS] of 2001 to 2007 and [Marcel] [Ospel] then President of board administrative
&apos; always thought that [Wuffli] and [Ospel] were a team perfect &apos; says the expert in [banca] Hans [Geiger]
&apos; [Wuffli] the intellectual modest that understand a of models and statistics and [Ospel] the [intuitivo] that managed showed step from the learning in the bank to the summit &apos;
Finally [Ospel] is [fió] of [Wuffli]
And the end [Wuffli] was probably a mistake decisive : &apos; [Pensó] that their models were a reality &apos; says [Geiger]
&apos; is a case tragic &apos;
[Trágico] perhaps
is clear : The [desatino] came before the case
The employees of the [UBS] is remember clearly of the meetings of toxic in the that [Wuffli] the head the consortium always [repetía] the same slogan : [Bajar] the throne to sink &apos;s
The bank American was the bank of investment more [poderoso] of world
[Encabezaban] the &apos; [League] [Tables] &apos; the [clasificaciones] that then [documentaban] the success of the banks
The [UBS] wanted be in the summit
Some steps to consequently well
In the operations of [divisas] and in the negotiating of actions was in what more high
However However the net of companies makers put of highlighted a point weak : In the business of interest international in the language of [banca] &apos; [fixed] [income] &apos; there a compensation huge for the large banks
The [UBS] has [vacíos] in the products [hipotecarios] Americans
For fill these [vacíos] the [UBS] started a adventure that almost to costs their existence
[Ávidos] of growth [invirtieron] therefore the same bank as one of their funds of high risk created in investments American of high risk
It transformed in a machine powerful for [titularizar] appropriations [hipotecarios] Americans and [venderlos] to continuation [manteniendo] certain risks to account own
And also as other banks suggestion the [bajada] for a time
&apos; In summer of 2007 as the market estate American was in [llamas] the [UBS] [compró] there &apos; said [Geiger] expert in [banca]
Only large the euphoria so thorough the fall
A workforce had that go already that the attempt of one s more complicated of what that were
The jobs in the [UBS] is became in seats [proyectables] and are [inseguros] to the currently
currently who at a great bank has a work almost impossible
must find a strategy for a bank to the that all the models of business [lógicos] are stumbling
[Geiger] expert in banks has a idea to end to the [banca] of investments focus in the administration of goods return to the roots [suizas]
The bank not to to so far ( still )
But the [banca] of investments must decrease a is clear currently
The next Thursday [Sergio] [Ermotti] the new President the bank will their future strategy the world
In reality only is was in the [italiano-suizo] of 51 years as a solution specify already that the bank the bank is [separó] surprisingly of their predecessor [Grübel]
Practical him is imposed : must to of way permanent the business of the [UBS] [comunicó] the bank of [Zurich] the Tuesday
[Ermotti] to restore the bank of investment to their state to middle of the 1990s
[Suprime] 3 500 jobs
But this not enough
The [UBS] needs a vision
it Who is
it With what to win money
These are the questions that sure is ago [Axel] charisma currently
far the time only says that first [buscará] a housing with their woman in [Zurich]

The smell and generous new book of Peter [Englund] The contest and the pain of the battle ( The [Beauty] and the [Sorrow] ) : A history [íntima] about of the First War World &apos; beginning with a long [dramatis] [personae] the kind that can do that to one is to [caiga] the soul to the feet
I here some by of action : [Arranque] [suavemente] this Indeed and [conviértala] in their mark pages
will to know very well to these people in the [narración] [novelística] of Mr [Englund] and this [dramatis] [personae] will as their [GPS] a [faro] for those few at in the that as one of their men and women is confusing and [desamparado] in the fog of the war
The Mr [Englund] is a I and journalist Swedish
also is the new secretary permanent of the Academy [Sueca] that giver the Prize Prize of [Literatura]
What that has writing here is a book little aware that describes rightly as &apos; a work of [anti-historia] &apos;
[Contiene] some names triumphs treaties important or frugal battles ; virtually not there ambassadors elegant journalists or further on tactical or material
not is therefore a book about of what happened explains as &apos; a book about of how happened &apos; deals about of &apos; feelings from experiences and states of humour &apos;
&apos; The contest and the pain of the battle &apos; being the experiences in times of war of more or least 20 men and women [ordinarias] to both both of the war from [colegialas] and [botánicos] to [escaladores] doctors drivers of suffered and administrative

Some is [convertirán] in prisoners of war or More their Member is will mad or [morirán]
Their lives [parpadean] here as [velas] [votivas] [encendidas] in a church ; a new is add to the a while other is go

This is a book [conmovedor] almost from the start
The war [inunda] the lives of these people as a disaster natural a Mitch hurricane that [apesta] to [cordita]
When the ceasefire of it is as in the distance and you a woman that is in home with your children it you [quedas] or [huyes]
In all forms it who next
Almost nobody understand what that is happening or even by what is has that fight this war

The people is means of ways [imprevistas] ; there therefore behaviour [innoble] as [heroico]
The Mr [Englund] about of the soldiers that us actively take a disease [venérea] of prostitutes as way of evade the service in the with
&apos; The expression more redeeming of this is can see the trade of Optimism [gonocócico] that the soldiers buy and [embadurnan] with this their [genitales] with the hope of end in the hospital &apos; it

The authorities municipal have denied categorically that prosecution
In a hearing in the [Ayuntamiento] the month last the [consejero] of education Ross Vries [Walcott] said that the redundancies were a part the budget approved in June
A Member of Council [contraatacó] him that nothing in the budget [especificaba] that the Member of staff of support of the school would dismissed
detailing the district municipal 37 said that tabled the complaint by writing [advirtiendo] the Department of Education of that would scrutiny It will a conference of press the Wednesday to announce the presentation official of the demand in the Court Supreme State in Manhattan
The demand include the Mr [Walcott] and the Department of Education of the city as accused and account with eight workers dismissed as complainant all them women blackest or [latinas] the as that the most of the assistants that lost their jobs
[Elizabeth] Greek spokesman of Department [Legal] of the city said that the city not had seen the demand and by what therefore not could do comments on their claims specific
According a draft of the demand successful by The New York Times the &apos; is has focused in the number of redundancies in the schools of areas poor of the city to support a complaint by treatment unfair saying that the schools poor lost more assistants already that had been [insuficientemente] contrary of way risk

&apos; [Sesenta] and six curiously of parents were dismissed &apos; says the draft of the complaint &apos; and not only in surplus &apos;
[Misión] draw the Congress prepared to to to a agreement on Libya
It that finally Republican and democrats in the [Capitolio] are prepared to only of agreement on something related with the embargo in Libya
all what that is needed was that the rebellion had success that the contractor dictator [Muamar] the Gaddafi outside attempted and murdered and the participation of States United came to their end
The Tuesday the Committee of Affairs Foreign of Senate is to be a resolution [patrocinada] by the President John [Kerry] ( democrat by [Massachusetts] ) together with the [senadores] John [McCain] ( [republicano] by coldest ) and Wresinski I [Lieberman] ( independent by [Connecticut] ) [aplaudiendo] to the who by their successful rebellion and to the troops of US US by their &apos; courage &apos;
&apos; This resolution is to [honrar] to the [valientes] of Libya the start to rebuild their country &apos; said [Kerry]
&apos; is a claim of support [bipartidista] to their aspirations democratic &apos;
The language can appear [inofensivo] but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy to now
This summer the legislators of both parties is [peleaban] between itself and with the House White on the significant of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the military of US US in the mission of the NATO in Libya
In June [Kerry] and [McCain] tabled a resolution that forming the use limited of forces military of US US in Libya
The project of law was [derrotado] in the House by a broader for [bipartidista] and that never came to [votarse] in the Senate
But the same day in that the project of law was rejected in the House the chamber also rejected a measure that would [recortado] the funds to the operations Americans in Libya
helps with the mission of US US in a kind of purgatory legislative - with the Congress what enough upsetting as for criticise the within by part of Obama of the mission but not so [enfadado] as to in reality [segar] the [hierba] under their feet
to continuation the [indecisión] of Congress was [superada] by the events
[Trípoli] fell in hands of the rebels who in August and Gaddafi was murdered the 20 of October
The mission of the NATO end officially the 31 of October
now the Senate could be completed for act
The resolution of Committee of Affairs Foreign &apos; welcomes the people of Libya by their [tremendo] courage and an resistance to shake to itself ourselves &apos; and &apos; commends to the men and women of the [Fuerzas] [Armadas] of States United and to their partners of the coalition that took in operations military to protect the people of Libya by their extraordinary courage and professionalism &apos;
The resolution also &apos; states the interest national of the States United in a successful and multi-year transition towards the democracy in Libya &apos;
it [Ganará] the new measure the completely support of the committee of Affairs Foreign or [dividirá] to the legislators as was the project of law of June
The last version was rejected by the Senator Richard G [Lugar] ( [Indiana] ) the main [republicano] of committee
The spokesman of [Lugar] said the Monday that not had seen still the version end the new project of law
At other hand the [Capitolio] the House is to vote this week on a amendment constitutional demanding a budget well-balanced a priority legislative for almost all the [congresistas] Republican and some democrats
The measure [patrocinada] by the [republicano] clocked [Goodlatte] ( [republicano] by Virginia ) be the first amendment constitutional on the budget or any other issue that of fact [logre] a vote of whole the assembly in the House or the Senate in this Congress
Other legislators not have had success to the time to do to their amendments to the assembly but not by lack of attempts
The of [Goodlatte] is only a of the 68 amendments constitutional that is have We in this Congress that [abarcan] a wider range of subjects
Some are [duplicados] - the same project of law is proposes therefore in the House as in the Senate - and other with small compensatory between itself
There by what least 15 versions of the amendment of balance budgetary so only in the House and another handful that &apos; orbit the expenditure federal &apos;
Some of those projects of law also are [idénticos] between itself but are to their [patrocinadores] - on all Republican job that for [refinar] their [currículums] - the opportunity of [jactarse] of that them were the &apos; authors &apos; of this measure
The Act of Audit of budget that was adopted in August [requirió] that therefore the House as the Senate voted a amendment of balance budgetary
In March 58 [senadores] voted to favour of a resolution not binding that supports the idea of that amendment
than beyond of budget several Member want limit the number of [mandatos] that the Member of Congress can to while that the representative José E [Serrano] ( democrat by New York ) to validity the limit of two [mandatos] to the chairmen
The representative [Jesse] L recycling [Jr] ( democrat by Illinois ) has proposed a series of amendments that an the right to a education of quality and attention health between other subjects
A amendment that prohibits the marriage ordinary is a proposal [perenne] so as a that prohibits the burning of flags
Some legislators also want allow the written-off of the laws federal if are been by two thirds of the states
Only enthusiasts that have been the Member to the time of propose amendments not is are pulling to a pace more quickly that in years previous
In the [111º] Congress the legislators Those 77 amendments and tabled 66 in the [110º]
The pace is unacceptable in compared with the of the the of 1990 when the Member made regularly more of 150 amendments every two years according figures [proporcionadas] by the [Biblioteca] of Senate
But not had a more success then of what that what have now
The last amendment that is added - the 27 - was void in 1992 but of fact was proposal by the Congress in [1789]

am sure of that the organizers they good intentions
It that the they
But not was respect of truth was [lástima]
The from [marcadamente] at incompatibility the difficult relationship that is has helplessness of the military and a public US to often [distante] to times [adorador]
It [prodiga] to the troops with praise by their sacrifices
But the [alabanza] has a price say the Member of service
The public each time more acts as if to [dieran] worth those [uniformados]
&apos; not are victims in all &apos; said the general of Colchester-based Whatever B [MacFarland] who [comandó] the troops in Iraq and soon [partirá] towards Afghanistan
&apos; But seems that the only way of that some Unless their support is put to us in the role of souls [desamparadas] &apos;
The issue is a issue very sensitive to the leaders military that not want appear [desagradecidos] or in disagreement with the public the that serve
also is are account of that the [ira] to the that is [enfrentaron] the troops that were in the last years of the war of Vietnam was a worst
As result the most of the discussions on the [lástima] is are to out in silence and in private between the [veteranos] of war

The achievements in the field of battle are rarely time elected to the [alabanza] by part of a country that has little [familiaridad] with the military and is few profits direct of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan

In change the praise of the political and the public is concentrate in great measure in the depth the suffering of a Member of service

Both in Iraq as in Afghanistan the equipment of women Soldier are [desempeñando] papers each time more important particularly to to to the women local in areas of war
The result : between these two wars 150 women Soldier have died and two thirds of them in situations of combat

The walls have eyes : How the researchers you are at in Facebook
Before of become in the new face of the extreme right in Europe Anders [Behring] [Breivik] was simply another kind that [aireaba] their points of view [anti-inmigración] in line
The Monday [Breivik] who deed have done a killing in Norway in July that with 77 dead is &apos; to their first hearing legal public
Meanwhile [Breivik] can have action only was far of be only in the [ciberespacio] : There last the greater part the time that preceded to their attack with to their computer [charlando] with some of the million of nationalists that support to the groups of right in networks social
After of the tragedy of this summer the researchers wanted know more about of these people
But it how [encontrarlas]
[Fácil] - only you that into in Facebook
&apos; We We account of that not was so difficult to to them &apos; says [Jamie] [Bartlett] author main of a report published recently on the populism digital European by the centre of studies British [DEMOS]
The [alijo] of information staff of Facebook is so [enciclopédico] says [Bartlett] that the researchers could simply use the tool of advertising for The their characteristics [demográficas] [deseadas] with a precise scientific - the way that the sellers have state they for years
The team of [Bartlett] found a million of fan of the groups of right in whole Europe and then them [dirigieron] announcements but in place of [vincularles] to a new bandwidth or product of [dieta] the announcements [invitaban] to the users to complete a survey that he on their level educational attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on their own future
At to to through of Facebook [Bartlett] and their colleagues were able of to to more of 10 000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 countries European - all without out of the office
&apos; is a way completely new of do a research &apos; says [Bartlett]
Some of the results not are the all surprising : The supporters in line of the groups of right tend to be young men and [enfadados] by the immigration
However However in a kind of issuing &apos; who that combined their [activismo] in line with the [activismo] outside of line are more reasonable more democratic and least violent that those that is are behind of the screen the computer &apos;
The work of [DEMOS] is only a example of how Facebook is is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists
[Centros] of research researchers doctors and scientists political are they the website for to all since problems of health to trends social such as is &apos;s in the &apos; I like &apos; messages in the walls and updates of state
With more of 800 million of users active [agregando] a average of three parts of content the day the &apos; [supernova] of data &apos; of Facebook is and a on of the research for the number of jobs academic with the name the website in the title to almost a 800 % in the last five years
For some researchers the contest of Facebook is that you allows to to the people to the that not [podías] [acercarte] with a [carpeta] in the street
&apos; Before when [intentabas] [encuestar] to people the Party National British was very difficult [identificarlos] &apos;
&apos; [Tendrías] that go to through the party and them never you creation the access &apos; says [Bartlett]
&apos; Facebook UEN all that - you to them directly &apos;
Other say that the website could provide a way of identify and address the problems of [salud-social]
A study recent done by the [doctora] [Megan] [Moreno] of the University of [Wisconsin-Madison] and their colleagues found that the students It that they of their [hazañas] of [borrachera] in Facebook they a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink that the students that refused in silence on the issue
[Moreno] suggests that the colleagues of the students such as the dispatches [residenciales] could control the website and intervene to help to a student that it too updates of state with their Binge
&apos; not you try a problem if not what you [diagnosticar] &apos; said Tadeusz [Christakis] the [co-autor] of [Moreno] and director the Centre of Health [Comportamiento] and Development of [Niño] in the Institute of Research [Infantil] of Seattle said the Washington Post
&apos; have found a way of identify children in risk that of another way not would [diagnosticados] &apos;
Facebook also is constantly &apos; [pinchando] &apos; to their own population to obtain data
The pull of Data the website has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the Day of St ribbons the expectation of participation election to half the period legislative of 2010 and a rate of [Felicidad] National ( mainly they the information to the that is can access - defenders of the freedom digital ago a time that maintain that the website should to to available of other their great amount of data to the research )
However However the users of Facebook know that the website them is looking them like or not - the [sacrificio] by power playing the [Scrabble] with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that the website [mine] your information personal
But it what is when the users of Facebook spend to be part of a survey that or even know
While that the researchers have guidelines well defined on how up their data outside of line in line is a [barra] free to all
&apos; not I that many of the users have considered even in the fact of that a scientists could be examining their profiles &apos; says outskirts [Selwyn] a sociologist of [Laboratorio] of [Conocimiento] of London on a study of 2006 that was to out with the walls public of Facebook of students
&apos; In what that to them precise was only between them and their friends &apos;
Then is the question of the methodology
Even outside of line not there guarantee of that a issue of research this being completely honest
In Facebook is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a user and of the messages the wall are truth
&apos; What that [dices] in Facebook and what that pensioner outside of Facebook are two things completely different &apos; says [Selwyn]
is by that that to despite of their years as scientists of the technology [Selwyn] believes that a [sujetapapeles] and a [bolígrafo] still being the best tools of research that nobody can use
&apos; not there substitute for into in the world real and about with the people real &apos; says
&apos; The research social is is that is on what social - and a lot of what social still is outside of line &apos;
&apos; [Frío] and inhuman : Anders [Behring] [Breivik] ago their first emergence public in the court
Anders [Behring] [Breivik] the man that [confesó] be the brain of the two attacks that were to 77 people in Norway this summer is has to to itself same as a [combatiente] of the &apos; resistance &apos; for their first emergence public in the court of Oslo
&apos; am a commander military in the movement of resistance Norwegian and in the Gentlemen [Templarios] of Norway &apos; said to a room full with 500 people
&apos; I am the court already that received the mandate of the organisations that support the ideology the hatred and because supports the [multiculturalismo] &apos;
&apos; I the facts but not I [declaro] guilty &apos;
The judge [Torkjel] [Nesheim] was to [Breivik] for that [monólogo] because &apos; not wanted give to [Breivik] the opportunity of use this hearing as a platform to that [exprese] their points of view &apos;
is the same reason is refused to allow to [Breivik] that by a speech writing with Reports address to the family of their victims the end of the hearing
[Nesheim] also Prosecutor to the police keep to [Breivik] under custody for 12 weeks more to faiths the access to the means of communication for four weeks and said that the authorities should that have a narrower control on all the visits and the [correspondencia] for eight weeks
manufacturing of 30 survivors and family of the victims attended to the hearing
Some as with the hope of look to [Breivik] to the eyes other to confirm that is is [recluido] under key
all attended with the aim of move towards the conclusion
&apos; I that seemed cold and inhuman &apos; said a [superviviente] of [Utoya] to the selected [] [] [noruega] [NRK]
&apos; It oust but to me was a step forward after of see and hear the suspect &apos;
[Vestido] with a suit dark and tie blue [Breivik] is remained [calmado] and professional to what long of the hearing and [miró] to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when it and went the building
to despite of the strange notion of [Breivik] of be part of a movement of &apos; resistance &apos; greater the judge [determinó] that not is a ill mental and said that not there evidence of that act with [cómplices]
is possible that to some them [consuele] that the attacks of 22 of July unimaginable be labour of a [extremista] in place of a group of radical
But that not [suaviza] automatically the pain and the confusion that whole a nation still feel
&apos; I would that prompt a monster but not what seems &apos; said a family of a victim
&apos; would a more easy if what prompt &apos;
7 [Lecciones] of the interview delayed of [Steve] [Jobs] is show in a theatre this week
After the death of [Steve] [Jobs] the 5 of October was some that what [compararon] with [Henry] Ford - [distinguiendo] the out of the technology as the Britain [Inventor] [Moderno]
But what that the fan of [Apple] could find more intend in a interview to [Jobs] recently [redescubierta] to the that is has [desempolvado] as embargo of a series of [proyecciones] special in the over markets this week is how about this mind [creativa] about of the processes trade and flows of work of the products
was without doubt a leather [soñador] and [hippie] [autorreconocido] but also was a inflated [meticuloso] and a [yonki] of the [diagramas] of flow - a man that [creía] that many place [sufrían] &apos; a disease that is in think that a great idea is the 90 by % of work &apos; but &apos; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product &apos;
In 1995 clocked [Cringely] was developing the number of television The [Triumph] of the [Nerds] ( The [triunfo] of the [idiotas] ) on the [albores] of computer staff and is sit for more of a time with [Jobs] for a can and rarely conversation
In this time had last barely 10 years since that [Jobs] had been forced to leave of [Apple] and already working reality in their new company It [NeXT] waiting the adoption popular of Internet
While that a small part of the interview of [Cringely] is used in [Nerds] said that the original of the interview dissolved during their transport
was only after of the death of [Jobs] that is Potočnik a copy full in [VHS] in the garage of director
This material of we slightly [reeditado] is the basis of [Steve] [Jobs] : The interview delayed of 68 minutes that is to the [cines] [Landmark] this Wednesday and Thursday
For someone known by [odiar] the interviews in depth [Jobs] here seems surprisingly prepared to forward their philosophies [tecnológicas] and strategies trade
And very [pensativo]
In four points different to what long of the interview there large [silencios] between the questions and the answers - of 10 to 15 seconds of [reflexiones] where [Jobs] is [sopesando] clearly their thoughts for precise
also there at in the that the [perfeccionismo] of [Jobs] its to the surface where seems [impaciente] because to the questions of [Cringely] [empujándole] to go more quickly towards the subjects or arguments of greater importance
[Filmado] before of the was of [Pixar] the [iPod] or the [iPhone] there something [extrañamente] [profético] in The interview delayed when [Jobs] [evalúa] what that is that other companies do well and is and does their own vision the future of the It
A thing is read assessments [póstumas] of the career of [Jobs] but there something oil and [inspirador] in the [Jobs] that see here the [soñador] [ansioso] the on of the greatness
He has a vision of as can and must be the things
not a after of [explicarlo] all with detail here was and what was
A quickly short of seven [secuencias] triumphs of The interview delayed :
On how [aprendió] to to a business :
&apos; to what long of the years in the business I always he : &apos; &apos; it is what pensioner things &apos; and the answers that you are of way [invariable] are : &apos; Oh that is only the way as is ago &apos;
Nobody know by what ago what that ago in the business nobody think in the things very deeply
That is what that I
[Jobs] has the detail their efforts to simplify the accounting of [Apple]
[Desconcertado] by the way in is [registraban] the costs - to often beginning with a &apos; cost standard &apos; that is was to eye of good [cubero] and that then is position with a &apos; one &apos; - developed a plant [automatizada] that [aseguraba] that could The the costs trade the detail
On the joke the Pope :
[Jobs] [narra] the &apos; cash Blue &apos; that him same was with [Steve] [Wozniak] - a has that up to the people [hackear] effectively the company telephone and do so-called to long distance free
It has writing widely about of has but the euphoria of [Jobs] here the under the cash Blue as a act of [empoderamiento] is [contagioso]
[Describe] how he and [Wozniak] [probaron] the box by the use of a telephone public doing a so-called and then [conectándose] from a network of [AT] [&amp;] [T] to other while [creaba] a [bucle] with the greater amount of satellite possible
&apos; right [envolviendo] the things around the world a average dozen of times and [gritabas] to through the telephone public and readjust a minute more later the telephone public of the door of the hand &apos; says [Jobs] with a [risita]
&apos; vintage people and what that [aprendimos] was that We build something us ourselves that could control thousands of million of dollars in infrastructure in all the world &apos;
We two not was a but We build a thing small that could control a thing heralded - was a lesson incredible and not I that never would been [Apple] without it
[Jobs] continues [describiendo] a joke [gloriosa] that he and [Wozniak] almost wayside [llamando] the heavenly to through of the cash Blue in half of the night and requesting about with the Pope while was their best imitation of [Henry] Kissinger
to measure that several Member of the hierarchy Catholic were [convocados] in half of the night for about with the diplomatic US the two [estallaron] in [carcajadas] fair before of that the [mismísimo] Pope outside reawakened to go to answer the telephone
On [enamorarse] of the technology ( and the sale by telephone with garage [Hewlett] ) :
to the age of 12 years to the hunting of parts of spare to build a [contador] of often suggestion to garage [Hewlett] in the on telephone and to was a so-called
Little after of their conversation telephone of 20 minutes [Jobs] managed a employment of summer to time - in mid-November
&apos; That was a remarkable influence on me was the only company that had seen to that age and was my vision of what that was a company and what well that [trataban] to their employees &apos;
[Jobs] is became after in one of the employees of [HP] that travelled the laboratories of research of the company in [Palo] High where was &apos; the first computer of table never fact &apos;
was so large as a sprinkler had a small screen of [tubo] [catódico] and I [enamoré] of him
[Conseguiría] a journey to [HP] as cared and [perdería] the time with that machine and [escribiría] programmes for it
On [improvisar] the innovation :
In several points of the interview [Jobs] about about of reinvent new products on the into
approaching in their career already that is he to sell a handful of numberplates basis to asked a client if could they all the team
[Trabajando] with only 30 days of credit had that physically the [montaje] and the over of the equipment [acabados]
than later while was in [Apple] reminds the struggles to the that is &apos; in the development of a [ratón] of computer :
&apos; I agreement of have arguments dramatic I [gritaban] that is be five years &apos; to create a [ratón] that [costaría] 300 dollars &apos; and I [harté] and I I outside and I a leather
[Noventa] days after had a [ratón] that We build by 15 dollars and that was completely reliable
On the large companies losing force :
[Mucho] before of that [liderara] the rooted of [Apple] [Jobs] [proféticamente] foresaw the way in that many leaders of the industry [tropezarían] in their vision and [perderían] the control of their share of market
&apos; privileges that [trabajas] in [IBM] or [Xerox] by what that pensioner [fotocopiadoras] and [impresoras] best it and what &apos;
You has the monopoly of the share of market by what that the company not has more success
The departments of sales and marketing increase the success by what that are this class of people the that end by to the companies and the people spreading of the products are [expulsadas] the forum to the decision-making of decisions
The out of the products that was to that position of monopoly is [pudre] by fault of people that not have the notion of good products [vs] one products - the knowledge of profession necessary
That is what that happened in [Xerox]
[Xerox] could have [adueñado] of whole the industry It
could have been ten times their size could have been the Microsoft of the years 90
[Tomaron] the defeat of the victory
On the innovation as expression artistic :
&apos; There a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product to measure that [evoluciona] the great idea time and overall &apos;
It learns a about of the [sutilezas] of the same
There sacrifices that you that do - some things that not you do that do the [electrones] the glass the ago the [robots] the do the factories the do
she that keep pool things in your brain - these concepts - [ajustarlos] all to the time
At end all is reduces the will - is worsening to to [exponerte] to what better that a team of human has fact and then try of which these things to the that your with doing
artistic said that the good artists copied the large artists [roban]
never have had shame about of steal large ideas
What that in part was large the [Macintosh] was that the people that were working in him were musicians [poetas] artists [zoólogos] 5th that wrong were the best scientists &apos;s of world
If not outside by the It could be doing things [maravillosas] in other camps
[Scalia] and Greek [cenan] with the rival of the law of assistance health while the court on the case
The day that the Court by is met to door closed for at the issue politically controversial of if [aceptarían] the challenge to the law of assistance health of President Obama two of their officers [Antonin] [Scalia] and [Clarence] Greek were [agasajados] in a dinner [patrocinada] by the signing of lawyers that [expondrá] the case to the high court
The occasion was the last Thursday when the nine judges is met in a hearing preparatory to to which the petitions of review
One of the cases in question was a demand a by 26 states [desafiando] the reform total of the assistance health adopted by the Congress the year last a law that has been a out of war for the activists Conservatives in all the country
The officers [acordaron] admit to rubber-stamping the demand and of fact is expected a plea historic of 5 hours and average to March and the result probably [enturbiará] still more the career presidential of 2012 that be in full for in the time in that the decision the court is No
The lawyer that [comparecerá] to the court and [alegará] that the law must be [desechada] be probably Paul [Clement] who was as tax general of US US during the government of Orwell [W] Bush
The signing of lawyers of [Clement] [Bancroft] [PLLC] was a of the almost two dozens of companies that [ayudaron] to [patrocinar] the dinner annual of the society [Federalista] a group that has many years into to the defence of the principles legal Conservatives
is signing that [patrocinó] the dinner [Jones] [Day] represents to a of the partnerships trade that [desafió] the law the Federation National of [Negocios] Experts
Another [patrocinador] was the heralded [farmacéutico] [Pfizer] [Inc] that has a huge interest financial in the result the dispute
The dinner is took in a hotel of Washington hours after of the hearing preparatory the court on the case
Among the assistants was between other Mitch [McConnell] the [republicano] more important in the Senate and a opponent declared of the law of assistance health
it The invited special in the dinner [Scalia] and Greek
not is nothing new : The two judges have state factual to events of the society [Federalista] during years
And not is something that between in conflict with the rules ethical
In fact the judges are [exentos] of Licence of [Conducta] that applied the actions of the officers federal lower
If not what They could said that [caerían] under the Licence [Canon] [4C] that says : &apos; A judge can attend to events for tax-raising funds of organisations relating with the law and other but the judge not can be a speaker a invited of honour or it in the programme of such event &apos;
However However the [proximidad] absolute of [Scalia] and Greek to two of the [bufetes] of lawyers in the case so as to a company with a huge interest financial was enough for [alarmar] to the activists of ethical in the government
&apos; This impressive gap of the ethical and fighters towards the code is in against of the demands of several officers that everyone the court by the same rules that is apply to all the judges federal &apos; said clocked fugitive the President of [Common] [Cause] ( [Causa] common )
&apos; The judges were [agasajados] in a - of funds of by with lawyers that have cases outstanding to the court &apos;
Their emergence and assistance in the - of funds for this event undermines any demand of benefited and is unacceptable
[Scalia] and Greek have shown little interest by the criticism that say that [mezclan] too easily the activity the court with the agenda [impulsada] by groups as the society [Federalista]
And the wife of Greek [Ginni] is a excel encountered 1905
is other part the Conservatives argue that is the [magistrada] Sakharov [Kagan] the that has a problem sexually-transmitted not [Scalia] and Greek
[Kagan] worked as [procuradora] general of the administration Obama when is tabled the first challenges legal to the law in the court of first to
Their critical have preferred to that [Kagan] is signing of see the case saying that was too [involucrada] in defend the law as to now be impartial
[Kagan] not has given no indication of that what will to do
loser In a asked record of 18 billion million of dollars
The [aerolínea] [Emirates] calls 50 planes of double sunlight loser [777] with option to 20 more
loser also sold six planes loser [Dreamliner] to [Oman] Air a operation valued in more of billion million of dollars
members time is news when a company this a asked of 50 units of their product
But is a great compromise when the company is the manufacturer of planes loser Co and the price of sale for the 50 planes out to a record of 18 billion million of dollars
is so large as the place of where loser received the order : East Middle a mine of gold in growth of will orders of planes
In a study given to know the Monday the company of Chicago estimated that for the next 20 years the audited in East Middle will 2 [520] planes by value 450 billion million of dollars

The [exitoso] asked wine of the [aerolínea] [Emirates] in [Dubái]
The [aerolínea] also has a option to buy 20 planes more what that accepted the price of sale total to 26 billion million of dollars announced loser in the scrum [Aeronáutico] of [Dubái] 2011
Then the Monday loser said that [Oman] Air had asked six loser [787-8s] the called [Dreamliner] that defeating of a saving of fuel and a services for passengers spectacular
The price of sale for six of them is more of billion million of dollars
&apos; This has clearly a huge effect positive to loser &apos; said the superiors of [Morningstar] [Neal] [Dihora]
&apos; The quality of these customers in particular is very strong &apos;
Many audited of East Middle are property of their nations [productoras] of oil
is what therefore not only have the money to pay the planes but that a increase in the prices of fuel - by what general harmful to the lines airlines because is one of the over costs - not is so harmful because the country is gaining money with the increase the price the oil
That is important because have least back that other audited of cancel or delay the orders of flight when the prices of fuel increase said [Dihora]
&apos; have a protection natural &apos; said
The asked of the [Emiratos] [solidifica] the leadership of loser in the market of planes of [fuselaje] wide and aid to keep to [raya] the attempt of their competitor Airbus [SAS] of invade their dominance with the on of passengers [A350]
The victory of loser in the [feria] of air is is four months after of that Airbus I that was to delay the debut the more large [A350] that disappear directly with the [777-300ER]
[Retrasó] the debut to add more momentum after of that the customers [exigieran] a increase of the burden useful and the senior
The actions of loser Co [subieron] a 1 5 % to 67 94 dollars

[Serios] [avisos] of Pentagon about of the possible cuts in defence
The secretary of Defence de [Panetta] [calentó] the Congress the Monday [advirtiendo] that the cuts dispensers of budget that is [avecinan] could be the safety national and to a reaction financial in chain from the corridors the Pentagon to the camps of battle of Afghanistan to the chains of [montaje] civilians
The Pentagon already is [digiriendo] the 450 billion million of dollars of tries to what long of the next the but now afraid a reduction additional of 600 billion million or more in cuts that can be imminent if the Congress not manages to to a agreement on the expenditure
&apos; The impact of these cuts be devastating for the department &apos; said [Panetta] in a letter to the [senadores] John [McCain] [republicano] by coldest and [Lindsey] [Graham] [republicano] by [Carolina] of South
said that the failure of Congress to to to a agreement on the budget and their result the called &apos; hostages &apos; Fico place to a 23 by % of tries global and a high to many projects new
&apos; A cut so large applied of this way [indiscriminada] would that the greater part of our projects sonars and of construction not is they &apos;s - not is can buy three [cuartas] parties of a ship or a building - and damage seriously other efforts of modernisation &apos; wrote [Panetta] to the [senadores]
&apos; also we [veríamos] forced to [apartar] to many of our officials civilians of way [involuntaria] and because to that the reduction is [impondría] with so quickly is almost sure that we that [licenciar] civilians with the end of to the aim &apos;
&apos; These changes [romperían] the faith with those that have our army and [dañarían] seriously the good available &apos;
The cuts with the time [alcanzarían] to the troops of combat said [Panetta]
&apos; If well the funding to times of war in the accounts of [Operaciones] of [contingencia] in overseas not is is directly affected by the hostages the efforts of the war is would affected adversely by the serious be in the budgets of basis &apos; emergency [Panetta]
&apos; The procurement of staff is [reduciría] what that would to delays in the contracts and the supervision the contract that supports the war &apos;
&apos; The staff in [nómina] is [reduciría] giving place to delays in the payments to the suppliers in time of war and the support legal and political be interrupted &apos;
The two [senadores] had writing to [Panetta] ago 10 days asking information on the possible impact of the cuts dispensers in the Department of Defence
&apos; The result of a hostages in the Department of Defence would a quickly decline of the States United as main power military of world &apos;
&apos; are strongly in against of this action [draconiana] &apos; said the [senadores] in a release whole the later of Monday when [publicaron] the letter of [Panetta]
&apos; This not is a result with the that is can live and certainly not is one that we Agenda to us ourselves &apos;
&apos; The hostages is a threat for the interests of the safety national of the States United and not is must allow that happen &apos;
If the letter of [Panetta] and the recent warnings of the [senadores] will the pressure for a commitment budgetary or scrupulously the so-called for [eximir] the Pentagon of the cuts is by see
[Panetta] has been each time more very on the possible cuts to despite of that came to a work in the top the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in the Congress and the House White and [sabiendo] that is [enfrentaba] to decisions difficult
In a conference of press the week last the secretary of Defence [pintó] a picture sombre of what that could be by front - a army with a [concha] but not a pounds
&apos; is a ship without sailors &apos;
&apos; is a Colchester-based without [balas] &apos;
&apos; is a went airline without enough volunteer trained &apos;
&apos; is a tiger of role a army of [cuarteles] buildings and bombs without enough soldiers image to to the mission &apos; said [Panetta] in their words of opening in the Pentagon

With that result the controversy constitutional [promovida] by the Senate of the Republic was [desestimada] by not achieve the most &quot; of eight votes for that the Court is [pronunciara] on the being or [inconstitucionalidad] of [decreto] and this is existing
The project of ruling produced by the Minister [Olga] [Sánchez] [Cordero] proposed on [inconstitucional] the [decreto] because to that the regulation of the raw of radio and television is a decaBDEs circumspect by law to the Commission Federal of [Telecomunicaciones] ( [Cofetel] ) in [contravención] of the principles of [subordinación] [jerárquica] and of reserve of law
to favour of project voted only [Zaldívar] George Mauro [Pardo] [Margarita] Moon and the own [Sánchez] [Cordero]

The replace of signs [analógicas] by digital is one of the changes more important that has suffered the world in the last years and is translates in a better [aprovechamiento] the spectrum make a better quality of the signal and more channels
[Aplazar] the change affirmed would [postergar] the profits of the &apos;s that means a decision of interest public that not has only a dimension technical &apos; therefore encompasses issues economic social policies and of safety national &apos;

This is a [extracto] of the conversation whose transcript full is in The [Nación] in Internet
For their followers [costarricenses] is a dream fact reality that [Pearl] [Jam] will to play in Côte [Rica] it are aware of what that are living their nowadays
[Ir] to Côte [Rica] is a dream fact reality to us also
This is hardly our second time in South and America and to now has been Preparations
I state in Côte [Rica] only a time and of holiday ; is a country so wrote and I that we to power slogans a days there
So that us [emociona] to our music there
It what wonder because there a kind of [devoción] towards the bandwidth the fan live with modern the days very
it What them say to their more [fervientes] followers
you by remain to our hand to through of all these years
We took almost 21 years to to Côte [Rica] ; thanks by have expected therefore and [lamentamos] that us has taken therefore time in to to there
terrific people even already is concerns to their of as the shows more large of year
it I adds that a little of pressure to their visit
Some of the [shows] more large that have [tocado] for the last 21 years [sucedieron] for the last couple of weeks
[Tocamos] a couple of [shows] [gigantescos] in [Sao] [Paulo] and we that that we has since in way to this of in Côte [Rica]
In truth we very desperately of play there
[Amamos] this country we love [surfear] and the [jungla] ; to both things Côte [Rica] is between the best the world
it How was that abused Côte [Rica] and their waves to [surfear]
We many friends that are [surfeadores] and I a great friend that lives in [Tamarindo] and the waves there are &apos;s
My friends always is would to [surfear] to Côte [Rica] and Nicaragua with with Mexico are large places for [surfear] ; so was how we [enteramos] by a of people that loves the [surf]
At see the revolves have come [entregando] [shows] enormous with many songs
it What have [planeado] to their presentation in Côte [Rica]
As never have [tocado] there before then not have any be on what that we do
[Intentaremos] give the best shows possible with a good variety of songs ; [trataremos] of play a couple of songs of every Georgian and them to our nowadays a good and diverse [repertorio]
You never are the [repertorio]
it to what is must this
I that is partially because we nine disks and we play more of 120 songs and to each one to them different songs so that is difficult decisions what songs play each night
When have two or three songs in the [repertorio] that have pink of not play that us maintained [enfocados] and also we maintained surprised because we reminds the reasons by the that us [gustaban] these songs and that is we could have neglected
That ago that the shows be more interesting to us and by therefore I that also what again more interesting to the people
With this revolves are made 20 years of very
At look back it is difficult of believe all what that have achieved
Yes absolutely
In first place I that none of us is heterosexuality that we in a great bandwidth of culturally and have fact by more of 20 years ago that some as a dream
We up our [bendiciones] and us [emociona] a that we to doing music together
all we want and we love create music
are lucky of go to places the world to the that always [quisimos] go
The things not could be best for us
it What meant to you the have been part fundamental the emergence the [grunge]
always has been a honour be part of that group of large gangs
are very friends of the people of [Soundgarden] [Mudhoney] and [Alice] in [Chains]
is surprising when a movement arises of a group of friends and is something little common
In time in when arises a bandwidth of a city but is a more strange when five or ten gangs out the same time of a same city
are proud and honest of be part the group of Seattle
still [tocamos] with some of them of time in when
The year last we in a festival with [Alice] in [Chains] and we in Canada with [Mudhoney] saw to [Soundgarden] in their revolves so that are lucky of be friends of all them still and us honour be part of this other of Seattle that about
also is very strange that a bandwidth as the of you is it united and with the ourselves Member by therefore time
Yes four of us we are together by 21 years and [Matt] ( square ) is we joined ago 13 years what which by itself only is a more time of that removal many gangs
In first place I that all are lucky of be still with life and in second all us preaching by the others
all are friends very those and thanks to that also is have open [avenidas] music that to are freedom to each one of shares
We likewise the a to the other with the music of each one and not could be best
The relationship of you with the word reputation not has been simple ; without However thanks to their success have been do what that want
it How are a balance
to as have gone growing has been more easy find a balance
We ensure of that not be too of revolves because is easy fall in this at of the large [multitudes] and of the people that loves your music
Meanwhile one democrat that the people is there by the music that you democrat that she respect the music and what that the by without [encapricharse] by be famous and be a culturally [star] something that to none of us really to interested
it How reminds their other project [Mother] [Love] [Bone]
I that [escribimos] very good songs and the principle was something Preparations
We a bandwidth by almost three years and never tracing a [disco] to that after of that [muriera] [Andy] ( manslaughter [Woods] )
There many [frustraciones] because [durara] therefore and what more important is that still are very friends of [Bruce] ( [Fairweather] ) and Greg ( [Gilmore] ) that they in the bandwidth with us and when hear a song or see a photograph I in the incredible person that [Andy] was and how I was laugh always was a pleasure go to work [reírnos] about of music and [futbol] and a more
was a be human surprising and what [extrañamos]
The bandwidth national The [Robertas] will the that of open the shows in Côte [Rica]
it is true that you know their work in special [Eddie] [Vedder] and that by that the [escogieron] to the opening
Yes the production we sent [videos] with several proposals and that was the bandwidth that more we pleased so that we desperately of see what that The [Robertas] can offer in in and duty be very &apos;
it is what always period the lyrics of [Yellow] [Ledbetter] in in
That is a question to [Ed] ( [Eddie] [Vedder] ) so that not I
He the singing and I that what ago with what first that is to happen
it As [bajista] what are their benefited
are many
s of the first that is I occur are [Geezer] [Butler] John [Entwistle] have J [Ramone] John [Doe] Paul [McCartney] [Chuck] [Dukowski]
are many that could about whole the later on the [bajistas] that I crazy
it How has achieved [Pearl] [Jam] keep relevant the [grunge] to despite of not be already a fashionable
I that all us always us we a little [desconectados] of the word [grunge]
When I in it I reminds the gangs that given before as [Mudhoney] [Soundgarden] [Nirvana] and all the that overview the same time and if there ascendancy now I that is something marvellous because is music that is the worth listen and gangs as [Mudhoney] are doing now better music that never
At principle their music had a content more dark and now is has again more positive
it to what is must this change
is interesting because I that there a couple of songs in the new Georgian that such time unimaginable more [livianas] but also there songs as The [End] or [Just] [Breathe] that as as songs very shameful but can sound a little Positive
With both when [Ed] I the [tocó] [lloré] when the I and are songs deeply shameful
I that when [creces] and there some [trauma] in your life and is lose to a family or a friend these things start to movement your art and your music and these two songs without doubt represent that for me
also I that is can be a person happy and still so power do music that be brown-skinned

all seems indicate that the [pesadilla] that living the neighbours of 51 of the street of [Balmes] has come to their end
Chernobyls people abandoned the at of yesterday volunteer the [inmueble] that high-ranking illegally and where [organizaban] [macrofiestas] that [desesperaban] the [vecindario] by order legal and without need of a intervention police
When end the operation is changed the [cerrojo] of the door to avoid that is repeat the situation
&apos; to from of now will a control of access &apos; said the administrator
The [okupas] that had rally 11 of the 13 strip the building - rest are [habitados-] is were whole the plant electricity and part of the of water also of paint the walls and to waste of all kind on all [latas] of excess excess
The three first Apartment were the stage of the parties [multitudinarias] that [duraban] to two days and [desesperaban] to the [inquilinos]
At hand of building there a [discoteca] [Balmes] 51 that also is has seen printed
Their owner [Maria] [Pantinat] he to Europe reporter that from that the building was occupied the business has down a 80 %
The owner of the [discoteca] as that the invaders of the [finca] to doing competition unfair already that [vendían] the [copas] to three EUR while in the [discoteca] [valen] 10
In the owner of local of leisure had had that respond to complaints [vecinales] by noise while according pointed the bother not the their the customers of the [discoteca] but the inhabitants of the home [okupada] and on all the assistants to the parties that is [organizaban] there that had increased their often and modern in the last weeks according the [enojados] neighbours of the area
The for of the [discoteca] he that the bother were so large that even came to a agreement with the you of [inmueble] and ago nine months that &apos; to [perdona] &apos; the for
The Álava [Urbana] also this that for the last weeks had received more complaints of neighbours by the situation
The President of group municipal of [PP] in the lives ex-President of commander had fugitive the week last &apos; [desalojar] of way immediate the [inmueble] to end with the problems of them and [civismo] that is to the neighbours so as the exacerbate of the area &apos;
The leader popular he that before the summer only had a floor of building occupied but to what long of the last months the [okupas] had gone their in all the plants of building and in almost all the strip and that in at even is have been seas
In this sense added that &apos; is necessary end with the impunity and be explain against the [incivismo] that is has led in the [finca] &apos;
also yesterday the [Mossos] [desalojaron] a building in [Nou] [Barris]
to the 15 30 hours the police is house-building to the 35 of the street of [Mont-ral] after receive the so-called of a neighbour that had seen that four people [accedían] the building
The four were detained in the time
it [Parque] or mountain
The architects line in the opportunity of the call more beyond of controversial on refunded
The Song municipal on the 16 doors [reabre] the debate on the role of [Collserola] in Barcelona
[Amediados] of the 80 in full for of the already [extinta] [Corporación] [Metropolitana] of Barcelona ( [CMB] ) this Administration [imprimió] a [pasquines] of promotion of [Collserola]
The [folleto] [definía] the mountain as the great park of the Barcelona cause
is more is [acompañaba] of a compared in figures with the Central [Park] [neoyorquino]
With the death of the [CMB] in 1987 the park the to [situarse] in the imaginary of many as the limit higher of Barcelona being the capital [catalana] of the few that not is [orientan] in the &apos;s north-south but down ( mountain ) [-abajo] ( sea )
The rating of [Collserola] as park natural &apos; in this idea
The reference already not was Central [Park] but [Yellowstone] with the [jabalís] in the role the [oso] [Yogi]
In these is was to that in September the lives [convocó] a [megacompetición] states by 16 notice for other so doors of access to [Collserola]
A door planned to the idea of park without doubt
Or that or someone intended to doors the field
The question its single : [Collserola] it park or mountain
The Song therefore by their it merely [organizativa] as by what that is of reflection on the city is the issue of conversation between all the architects [barceloneses]
is almost already a issue recurrent the that it hand when two Member of this former untouchables of elected is recognise in a lift
And this fact of ordinary precisely to a of the few [coincidencias] between what that opinion three architects [barceloneses] and teachers It that is have presented
Miguel [Roldán] Daniel [Mòdol] and [Marta] [Bayona] : the Song is right
For [Roldán] after addressed the with shallow &apos; is ago necessary &apos; discuss on &apos; the with of mountain &apos; whole time that the speech of [Ildefons] [Cerdà] the of the premium devote not is has taken to out
&apos; One from of the basis of that the park more trout of Barcelona is the a
Among other things by their great [accesibilidad]
[Collserola] is more complex &apos; ruling the architect to who the title of &apos; doors of [Collserola] &apos; within a &apos; trap [léxica] &apos; : not there that think in them &apos; as the [accesos] to a park but the [delimitación] of a areas where there that act &apos;
[Mòdol] as [Roldán] and [Bayona] with experience in the world [urbanístico] described the proposal of &apos; challenge intellectual &apos; with &apos; some dangers &apos;
[Peligros] derivatives of what &apos; uncertain that is today day project the space public &apos; after the experience [vivida] in the 80 and that had in the area the [Fòrum] &apos; their low-key of [cisne] &apos;
The first fear is the own [delimitación] of a borders on where is can build
&apos; baby something is them already the next step &apos; is say their [sobrepaso]
&apos; There that think in new instruments [urbanísticos] of planning because the current &apos; in reference the Plan General [Metropolitano] ( [PGM] ) &apos; can give ordinary to [auténticos] disasters &apos;
than [ceñido] to the question [Mòdol] view that [simplificando] the it [vallesana] of [Collserola] &apos; can should as a park the of Barcelona not &apos; by a question merely [topográfica]
[Mòdol] reminds that already is a work fact by the [Patronat] of [Collserola] that &apos; not must fall in together it &apos; but thanks the opportunity that the lives does to their [gremio] of intervene in this project &apos; from the first time &apos;
And still more understand that the [cercanía] of the mountain with the city is the convince that allows to the architects into in the debate but &apos; doubt &apos; on if is this profile technical the that must lead the teams [multidisciplinarios] ( &apos; all a likewise &apos; as ) that is have had that create : &apos; The architects should be only a tool &apos;
[Bayona] nothing that the response to the question that of title to this one is complex because in the foundation of Song lack a vision global of [Collserola] : &apos; It have blessing 16 notice Also [-dice-] in the sense [montaña-mar] but not is a reading [longitudinal] that see and understands the area in their whole &apos;
This from the least in their case that has choice by participate in the 16 notice
In other way a project to a of the doors can [chocar] in programme and definition with the the architect of the door of the hand
In their opinion that itself the lives should ensure that the Strip immediately higher to the Round of [Dalt] should at in whole their spread a area of [equipamientos] that [efectuara] a softly transition between the city and what green
[Casino] [perdona] to [Jonás] [Larrazábal] and nothing free
Then of [72] days of [arraigo] the helplessness legal of [Casino] Network [otorgó] the forgiveness the brother the mayor of [Monterrey] the process that is to was by [presuntos] [chantajes]
Then of remain [72] days recognized Manuel [Jonás] [Larrazábal] nothing in freedom then of that the helplessness legal of [Casino] Network to [otorgara] the forgiveness to the [Juzgado] second Criminal of marked that still a process by blackmail against the brother the mayor of [Monterrey]
Then of attack the [Casino] [Royale] the you of [Casino] Network [Sergio] [Gil] evacuated was public a series of photographs and [videos] in the that [presuntamente] Manuel [Jonás] to requirements the payment of a share economic for that the lives [regiomontano] allowed the operation illegal of the home of betting
After the concession public the [Procuraduría] state was a process criminal against the brother the mayor [panista] and the 2 of September was arrested and deep-rooted by 30 days
Then of four hours to the [Agente] of Ministry [Público] 3 in [Delitos] [Patrimoniales] was made to the House of [Arraigo] 1 within in the [Barrio] [Antiguo] of the capital of State
In that place [permaneció] for the 49 days following the [dictársele] a second order of [arraigo] then of that the or of Ministry [Público] [desechara] the crimes of [cohecho] and crime organised
The 19 of October was made the criminal of [Cadereyta] [presuntamente] by [chantajear] with a million and a of lightweights to the owners of [Casino] Network ; without However only [permaneció] a hours in the [reclusorio] of medium-sized safety already that were threats of death in their against
The authorities to allowed to the trial [internado] in the cells municipal of St taxpayers of the [Garza]
The 25 of October is to cell order of [aprehensión] by the secretary the [Juzgado] second Criminal of marked George [Yánez] who said that to almost two months of [averiguaciones] is [comprobaron] enough evidence to The the assumed of [Jonás] such as the collection of 1 5 million of lightweights to the representatives of the home of betting to change of allow the operation of the same
This Monday the helplessness legal of [Casino] Network Vittorio [Aldo] evacuated [Gómez] out to the [juzgador] José [Luis] [Pecina] to apply the forgiveness to the brother the mayor [regio] ; by what that in the next hours could to their freedom
During the [diligencia] legal the or of Ministry [Público] [adscrito] the [Juzgado] [Ramiro] - [cuestionó] to evacuated [Gómez] if is had repaired the damage and who of the partners of the home of betting was the that [otorgó] the forgiveness but the lawyer tried Event the name
With basis the dossier reconversion / 2011 is this the forgiveness legal to [Jonás] [Larrazábal] and in what [sucesivo] not will stand complaint any in about the process that is to was ; also of that not is to [exigirá] [reparación] of damage or punishment
After the hearing the helplessness legal of the home of betting close of the 15 : 50 is Prosecutor the immediate freedom of [Larrazabal] [Bretón]
The secretary of [Juzgado] George [Yánez] is found to the prison of prayer of St taxpayers of the [Garza] to if to [Jonás] that has been [perdonado] legally and their dossier will [archivado]

The secretary [Dionisio] publishing [Jácome] of details of accident air where lost the life the secretary of [Gobernación] Franz [Blake] and seven people more
The [Secretaría] of communications and Transport ( [SCT] ) reported that the results thrown on the accident where lost the life the secretary of [Gobernación] Franz [Blake] [Mora] and seven people more show that the grant is [impactó] of way direct on the ground in full integrity structural without that the pilot could to a landing implications
During a conference of press [Dionisio] publishing [Jácome] secretary of communications and Transport mentioned that before of controllers the [aeronave] the pilot Funds that the conditions of climate were the right for fly
&apos; The elements that seem indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground the [aspas] had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the [fuselaje] &apos;
also reported that the unit was sewn for 19 people by what that had with the [requerimientos] necessary to carry the personal
In said that in the investigations made in the area the impact not is [reporta] the emergence of parts in the ground
&apos; In a search is our that not there parts or components of the [nave] in another place the impact is presented of way structural
&apos; The design the grant was for 19 passengers had with [requerimientos] We for [trasportar] to the passengers
The ground is a outstanding of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of gradient
is the time the secretary was that is a priority have with the results before possible ; without However the research can last several months even could achieve a year
is their part [Gilberto] oxide honoured director general of [Aeropuertos] and [Servicios] [Auxiliares] was that the time the impact the grant of state Army [Presidencial] [operaba] in speed of cruise and that this happened in a ground [blando] ascending
&apos; This information strengthens the [hipótesis] of a operation normal of cruise the time the impact &apos; expressed
In the conference of press the wheat of the [SCT] publishing [Jácome] [enumeró] six element relevant in the research :
[Vuelo] about :
accordance to the [normatividad] Ôhe the flight is was under the rules of flight about this means that the [tripulación] must have visibility for the flight and the ground
[Condiciones] likely :
The [reportes] in the [AICM] [ubicaban] conditions right the sleep with is the [aeronave] towards the area deeply between the [DF] and the state of Mexico is made facilitated of [nubosidad] to low level
[Rutas] [seleccionadas] :
is likely that by the conditions of [nubosidad] the [tripulación] has [buscada] a area of will raising and greater visibility towards the valley of [Cuernavaca]
[Ubicación] of impact
The [coordenadas] of impact and the last registration of the [aeronave] the radar line probably before the impact not was loss of control or at in the very of flight
[Dispersión] of remains of the [aeronave] in a area reduced :
The information available to the time it mean that the impact happened in a very straight and of hand
The [patrón] of [dispersión] of remains of the [aeronave] it mean that the grant is [impactó] in the ground in conditions of integrity structural
not is has been obvious of ceasefire or explosion :
In the website of are still without [revelarse] [evidencias] in the remains of the [nave] of some kind of explosion or ceasefire
The last results of the research show that could have had multiple contacts with the ground
During the jobs of field is have found parts of the [aeronave] to a raising of 9 billion 200 feet on the level a of sea the ground is a outstanding that is from the seven degrees to 30 degrees of gradient
The photographs show the sequence in the that expected is [desarticuló] to what long of said way
The information provided elements that seem indicate that the grant could have had multiple [impactos] in the ground
After of the search It in a area more wider that the website [acordonado] around of accident not is have found parts pieces of the [aeronave] what that strengthens the presumption of that the impact is presented in conditions of integrity structural
[MSS] is protocol to finding gene of obesity
[Dirige] the certain security a research to be the gene of the obesity in children and young ; is supported in specialists of [IPN]
The Institute Mexican the certain security ( [IMSS] ) announced that at a research to be the gene of the obesity in children and young so-called protocol &apos; [Genética] of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence &apos; that will have with [marcadores] with the obesity
In a release the head of the Unit of Research [Médica] in [Bioquímica] of smoke-related of [Especialidades] of Centre [Médico] National [Siglo] 21st Miguel Cross oxide he that is in-house a team [multidisciplinario] of doctors nurses [nutriólogos] and workers social
In team is supported by specialists and a of [postgrado] of Institute National of Health Public ( [INSP] ) and of Centre of Research and of lawmaking [Avanzados] ( [Cinvestav] ) of Institute [Politécnico] National ( [IPN] )
In the research is taught to participate to the population be or not [derechohabiente] come to the units sporting participants the [IMSS] in the Valle of Mexico where is are to out the evidence to the under all the I to from of the 8 : m hours
[Destacó] that the protocol started in the Unit [Deportiva] [Cuauhtémoc] ( state of Mexico [Poniente] ) and that since the 8 of October the activity is has to out in the Unit [Deportiva] [Nezahualcóyolt] ( state of Mexico East )
A time that is ! the aim of together to 500 or 600 under the study Unions in the Unit [Deportiva] strength ( southern of marked Federal ) and finally in the Unit [Deportiva] [Morelos] ( the north of marked Federal )
[Explicó] that the purpose of this research is know the components and the importance of the genetic with regard the development of the obesity and identify in children and young interest factors of risk to prevent the emergence of diseases chronic [degenerativas]
At have this 14 of November the Day World of the [Diabetes] [precisó] that the aim is together to three thousand children and young between six and 14 years of age with the consent and supervision of their parents to the implementation of [cuestionarios] specific on food
also is them [preguntará] on the activity physical and background [heredofamiliares] of diseases with the purpose of avoid factors of risk that [desencadenen] [padecimientos] as diabetes or inadequacy [renal]
[Detalló] that the I is them applies to all the participants measurements [antropométricas] ( weight stature circumference of [cintura] ) decision-making of pressure instances determination of the levels of [glucosa] [triglicéridos] [colesterol] and insulin and beings ( is search identify genes that is [asocien] to the obesity child )
Cross oxide out that this research temper to the concern of the professionals of the health by the alarming increase of weight in the under
&apos; The out of health of 1999 and 2006 signal that in so only six years was a increase in the case of the children of 77 by % in obesity and of the girls of 47 by % ; in terms of obesity also is observed a rise by &apos; skills the specialist of [IMSS]
[Indicó] that the justification for the search of the [marcadores] is [sustenta] in that the population the country from of other by their history genetic
informed that in average the Mexican has 65 by % of inheritance Indian American 30 by % European and five by % Africa and this condition is reflects in the genes that is take to disease and too of weight
[Explicó] that of way general the genetic of the obesity is translates in the inability of baby the too of energy that [consumimos] ( lowcalorie ) and that is transported in way of blubber
The scientists he that the benefit direct to the participants is the assessment contained of the children what that allows detect if have some degree of obesity or obesity
Even said the presence of [pliegues] of colour [obscuro] ( [acantosis] ) in bottleneck and [antebrazo] that show the likelihood of that [padezca] [alteraciones] [metabólicas] and to [prediabetes]
The information is &apos; of way confidential the doctors the [entregan] by writing to the parents to who is them explains each a of the measurements and the changes in the lifestyle of life that must to to prevent diseases
Cross oxide he that there three components main that cause obesity obesity and other [padecimientos] [crónicos] : the [sedentarismo] that is the lack of activity physical daily remain the greater part the day at with the television and use means of transport in place of walking travel short-haul
also is must to the high [ingesta] [calórica] is say the greater consumption of excess [azucaradas] of [carbohidratos] ( [tamales] bread [pizza] hamburger etc ) with high content in unprocessed and protein and the genetic that is analysing in this protocol
[Asfalto] of the [UNAM] [evitaría] pretty
programme [Herrera] scientists of the struck of [Química] of the [UNAM] develops [asfaltos] which with [polímeros] to produce a a with better every regardless of the conditions environmental and of temperature
If the signs that are the [pavimento] like - not be necessary [reparar] close of 200 billion pretty each season of dry in the [Zona] [Metropolitana] of Valle of Mexico emergency programme [Herrera] [Nájera] scientists of the struck of [Química] ( [FQ] ) of the [UNAM] who was that if the process of construction and it of a [pavimento] [asfáltico] is the appropriate the pretty could radioactivity in amount or even disposed by completely
In their conference A opinion technological of the pretty [dictada] in the framework of Year International of the [Química] was to know that the laboratory to their office develops [asfaltos] which with [polímeros] to produce a a with characteristics like to the the she but with a greater resistance set-up therefore to high as to in temperatures
[Herrera] [Nájera] [estimó] that this kind of [asfaltos] which could used in places where the climate is extremely a as some cities the north of country to improve their every and by what therefore the training of pretty
[Explicó] that the she the part more disproportionately of oil is a whole of [moléculas] of [hidrocarburos] a of high weight [molecular] so-called [asfaltenos] and other of under weight [molecular] so-called [maltenos] that Money to are the [pavimento] their characteristic behaviour [viscoelástico]
The behaviour [viscoelástico] of she is in that to high temperatures close of the U-turn degrees is means as a tanks to 120 degrees degree their [viscosidad] is very high and to 50 degrees degree is a state almost part while that to temperatures very in the she is again [quebradizo] added
What previous means that in the streets the resistance of she not is uniform but that is is constitutes for the day of agreement with the conditions environmental and of temperature emergency the specialist in engineering chemistry
The scientists of the [FQ] observed that the streets of the City of Mexico in their most are covered by [pavimento] flexible the which is consists of six facilitated of materials of the which the last three [involucran] the she
Among the facilitated more [superficiales] is is the [carpeta] [asfáltica] [conformada] by small stones [bañadas] in she and then [compactadas]
Every a of the [piedritas] that is the [carpeta] pointed is [bañada] with she
At [transitar] the vehicles and [generarse] efforts this allows that the forces is are very well in the [pavimento]
If is like of she amended is [difundirían] still better opinion the engineering chemical
On the [carpeta] [asfáltica] [abundó] is put a last layer so-called [carpeta] of [rodadura] the which is nation of a material of stone fine is say a bit that also is [baña] in she
As is is of the layer that is to be in contact with the [llantas] of the vehicles must have more force set-up that the [carpeta] [asfáltica] and provide [fricción] in the way
At be the part the [pavimento] that is to receive and salvage the efforts the [carpeta] of [rodadura] required also have the thick appropriate and is must they the material of that is nation
The climate particularly the moisture and the compensatory of temperature also are a factor very important to be in special the water said because affects significantly the every of the [carpeta] [asfáltica]
When the ground is [humedece] the water is disseminate in the internal of the [carpeta] and is difficult that from this level a [reblandecimiento] of all the facilitated the [pavimento] and by what therefore the training of pretty
In the process of training of a [bache] said the first in [desgastarse] is the film of [rodamiento] and only after is affects the [carpeta] [asfáltica] but the damage not happens [instantáneamente] but that is a process that should [atenderse] to the first signs with We programmes of it
The also Member of underlined National of [Investigadores] he that the burden [vehicular] is another factor important in the training of pretty and by this the thick of each a of the facilitated the [pavimento] must go always in relationship with the burden [vehicular] and ensure that is ! to avoid that is train pretty [frecuentemente]
programme [Herrera] emergency that still there a that with and work on the she by example the [emulsiones] [asfálticas] that in other countries already is are even in the market and it [reparar] the pretty with easily and without need of use high temperatures
it What to wilfully to the Mayor of Valle to be the new [señorita] Colombia
[Análisis] of the factors that [incidieron] to that [Melina] [Ramírez] [Serna] not [alcanzara] the nickel of [Señorita] Colombia
The Valle In their title number 14 of recounted
In new the Valle of [Cauca] is is with the wish of the nickel of [Señorita] Colombia
This time [Melina] [Ramírez] [Serna] is had that shaping with be in the [podio] of [ganadoras] [lucir] the nickel of silver and the bandwidth that the [acreditan] as new recounted of Colombia
With the result successful [anoche] in [Cartagena] where the [señorita] Atlantic is [alzó] with the nickel and the [cetro] the department already sum 14 titles of Crown and [Melina] is a to the [legión] of women [vallecaucanas] that have state close of the nickel but that were [proclamas] [princesas] between them of [Ospina] [Benoit] ( Istrian ) [Clara] [Domínguez] [Borrero] ( [1949] ) from [Bellini] [Ayala] ( 1979 ) was Álvarez ( 1981 ) [Rose] Mary [Alzate] ( 1983 ) [Olga] María [Arenas] ( 1987 ) [Leila] [Blanque] ( 1988 ) [Mónica] [Evers] ( 1989 ) María [Consuela] [Pinedo] ( 1990 ) [Diana] [Isabel] [Romero] ( 1993 ) [Giselle] [Garcés] [Aljure] ( 2000 ) [Catalina] [Giraldo] ( 2007 ) [Stephanie] [Garcés] [Aljure] ( 2008 )
Today the great question that many is do is it What wilfully
Because the result represents the defeat of a great [favorita] that in each presentation proved that it had all to be the new [Señorita] Colombia not in vain was elected [Reina] of the Police and better [Rostro] [Jolie] of [Vogue] titles that able [reinas] as [Taliana] [Vargas] or [Natalia] [Navarro] who is were the nickel of [Señorita] Colombia
The first factor that is as key in the decision that took the jury of [designarla] First Crown assurance in that not [convenció] with their response to the question &apos; it What is this book that you has there to you and by what nation by [Martín] [Murillo] [Gómez] of the [Carreta] [Literaria] [Leamos]
At [interrrogante] the [vallecaucana] replied :
&apos; shall a I quite in the literature I that is a way of [culturalizarse] definitively I that the book that I espoused of childhood is &apos; The [principito] &apos; is a book quite their
currently [leo] &apos; [Crimen] and punishment &apos; is a book of literature universal that all we read ; and today in day I read the book of [Irene] [Nemirovski] a Russian a book [hermosísimo] that is way &apos; The [ardor] of the blood &apos; &apos;
A response that little pleased first by the term &apos; [culturalizarse] &apos; and second by not explain of way particular of what way each one of the books that [citó] the have there
But the conclude the ceremony [Melina] manifested your relaxed and happy with the result &apos; the universe is [sabio] is what that has that to
And for whole the people by favour read a [poquito] &apos; The [principito] &apos; is a great book &apos;
Among the [hipótesis] been is says that to Valle the [quemó] the [favoritismo]
A journalist [bogotano] [insinuó] that the be the theories the [ovacionada] and the Mayor that is was all the prizes preliminary ( challenge of [gastronomía] [Oster] vote the public by the best suit notions and [Reina] troubled ) &apos; that kindled the [celos] of the other has [estresó] to the and and by that not [brilló] in the stage &apos;
And that is [notó] in their first presentation in suit of It in the a of [Hilton] and their two [desfiles] in the evening of [coronación]
Although in both [lució] safe is [notó] that to missing the force and the impetus that the representatives of [Magdalena] and Atlantic itself Valley
Ariel [Osorio] journalist the programme &apos; As in home &apos; the wave [RCN] opinion that the fact of that [Melina] outside abroad recounted &apos; apparent that the Mayor that more prizes earns for the Song not is as and &apos;
In Valle is was to what last very [esquiva] with the press and there is [equivocó]
is [hipótesis] is that Valle not in persuade the jury on their interest towards the work social that is in last the essence the [Concurso] National of [Belleza]
is something two days before of the election the jury international [Lucy] [Doughty] manifested that them [buscaban] a woman [comprometida] with the needs social of their [pais]
&apos; The contest single not enough in a [Miss] Colombia there that look region beyond of what physical and Firstly in their sensitivity social that before of imply the [Concurso] are already [involucradas] in projects &apos; he
also is [especula] that Valle [pecó] by their flaws in the [derriere] and the [fibrosis] that is to [notaba] in their [abdomen] but is experiences therefore precisely the jury the made as the Mayor &apos; [Belleza] natural &apos; with the body more healthy good food and work physical for
The [preparador] of [reinas] George [Hernán] [Orozco] recognised that [Melina] not had the better body that had best &apos; but their problem of [fibrosis] in the [abdomen] that the truth for my not was very [notoria] to struggle points in the last day &apos;
Among therefore the journalist Guido [Hoyos] of the magazine [Cromos] as that the mistake of the [vallecaucana] were the speeches [quirúrgicas] that is [practicó]
&apos; The [cirugías] are well but Valle not is the was do
Their body never was their strong and here is the [cobraron] &apos;
is this was that by first time over the [Concurso] National of the [Belleza] after of playing in suit of It about a debilitating [vaticinio] that [anoche] is perform therefore is said that this was the [contentillo] that [Raymundo] to [concedía] to [Melina] to not you the will of the nickel
[Realidad] or not what true is that [Melina] from today starts a year of [reinado] not as sovereign but as recounted position that to offered the possibility of represent to Colombia in one of the [certámenes] international by designation of own [Concurso] National
However however it will to the history as a of the [reinas] that to despite of their [arrollador] step by [Cartagena] to was [esquiva] the nickel
So was the work the [caleño] that lighthouse the [cadáver] of [Alfonso] [Cano]
A [lofoscopista] of [Cali] happened to the history as the man that this the death of &apos; [Alfonso] [Cano] &apos;
The work of these officials is key
The last 4 of November a [lofoscopista] of [CTI] of [Cali] happened to the history as the man that this the identity of maximum head of the [Farc] : &apos; [Alfonso] [Cano] &apos; to through the [cotejo] of their fingerprinting digital
In the seven [lofoscopistas] that [laboran] in the [seccional] of [CTI] that week to [tocaba] the time of &apos; availability &apos; to [Eliazar] González a man of Rico [Tejada] that has 21 years working in the area of research legal
At an their career González worked in municipalities of [Chocó] where many times had that [internarse] by more of five days in the jungle to to the website in the that were the bodies that be be at
In the 2000 is found to the capital of Valle and then of to the for appropriate is [especializó] in [lofoscopia] that is the study of the fur of [fricción] is say of the [palmas] of the hands and of the feet
The week the operational against [alias] [Alfonso] [Cano] to [Eliazar] to warned that 22nd clothes minimum to three days
Something large to expected
The Friday in the night went for the [Cauca] in a grant from [Palmira]
[Sabía] that should identify two bodies and that is [sospechaba] that one of them was the man that respected to the [guerrilla] more former the world by what that to ’ that 22nd the card [decadactilar] of psychologist de [Sáenz] ( their real name )
However However when came with the team of research the website in the that is was the [cadáver] not what recognised by their aspect physical therefore was very different the that had seen in the means of communication
was without [barba] clothing as a plead of the area without glasses and a more slip
But the fingerprinting not [mienten]
[Acompañado] of a [lupa] [galtoniana] ink a [transplantador] and a [linterna] [Eliazar] [comparó] the from fingerprints of [cadáver] with the of the card
Their eye not to [falló] : was &apos; [Alfonso] [Cano] &apos;
That same night the man [oriundo] of Rico [Tejada] was the The of [confirmarle] the minister of Defence John Charles [Pinzón] that itself is was of maximum head of the [Farc]
In search of the left
For a [dactiloscopista] of the [Sijín] of [Cali] the recognition that was the President John Manuel the to [Eliazar] González in the wheel of press by the operational against &apos; [Cano] &apos; is very significant
Many people not known our work
The [dactiloscopia] is a science accurate without for of mistake that can to to be key in the resolution of crimes
Apart of the identification of bodies the [lofoscopistas] support investigations by crimes as [hurto] and murder and Chicago the identity of the people [capturadas]
When is aliens many criminals have [cédulas] wishful or not have papers
We them we the impression [dactilar] and the look in the basis of data
The scientists counted that in a case of [hurto] to [tocó] validity a part of wall of a home therefore in this place the do had supported their hand to from a box strong full of [joyas] and money
&apos; The walls are difficult because not are land [apropiadas] to from a impression [dactilar] but in this case we obtain the left of whole the hand and identify the criminal that had participated in different [hurtos] &apos; reminded
The fingerprinting also can seeking or reaffirm suspected in cases of murder
ago little found to a man died with wise of [licor] to their around
is a of the research is [determinó] that a family could be suspect the crime and effectively a left in the bottleneck [coincidía]
Although this not an that has been the murderer itself what [ubica] in the scene the crime
A [dactiloscopista] of [CTI] he that in the items &apos; the fingerprinting is [sacan] with [reactivos] chemical or physical &apos;
When officer is used a [transplantador] or tape for [levantarlas]
Then of this the from are settlement to the [Asif] that is the basis of data [delincuencial] or to the [Registraduría]
&apos; The problem is that still there many dead-end xenophobic &apos; pressed the expert of [CTI]
[Aclaró] that not all is as is shows in the programme of television [CSI]
So as not all what that which is gold not all what that is is is again left
However However if can be [usada] if is for the [cotejo] dynamic
The &apos; [indignados] &apos; defy to authorities in New York
[Centenares] of demonstrators is intimidatory to the place [Zuccotti] for [acampar]
A great part [atendió] the order of [desalojo] and is found to a [paruqe] have
The those the movement [Ocupa] Wall Street [desafiaron] this Tuesday to the authorities of New York the try of into of new under the under of a order legal to the place of Manhattan of where were [desalojados] of brave and the try of should another park of the Britain [Manzana]
[Centenares] of demonstrators is intimidatory to the place [Zuccotti] where wanted access thanks to a order legal that allows to the &apos; [indignados] &apos; again to [acampar] in the place while that other part the movement replied the [desalojo] may a park more the north of the city where has there new arrests
&apos; Our idea is that if the court not us allows again to [acampar] in the place we we to on in some other place and [continuaremos] the battle legal by again to [Zuccotti] so as to through of around and demonstrations peaceful &apos; said one of the for the movement &apos; [Ocupa] Wall Street &apos; Mark [Bray]
[Bray] [detalló] that the answer of the &apos; [indignados] &apos; the [desalojo] of their camp dictated personally by the mayor of New York Michael [Bloomberg] came to the courts where the [jueza] [Lucy] [Billings] issued a order that [prohibía] the evacuation [forzosa] the place and up to the demonstrators to be [acampados]
In the &apos; [indignados] &apos; [procedieron] to the occupation of a new park has in the [confluencia] of the [céntricas] wave Street and the [Sexta] [Avenida] very close of the entry the tunnel [Holland] that unite New York and New Jersey and property of the used of [Trinity] [Church]
At least for a time overpower should the place but after the Police out and were to stop to some of the demonstrators but [Bray] not could confirm the figure concrete while was to [Efe] that was to several journalists that were also [esposados]
The organisation ensures that are several hundreds of people the that is had installed in this point where already is has [desplazado] a delegation of leaders religious in shows of support to the those the movement and that has treaty of [mediar] with the Police
Among therefore the place [Zuccotti] - is a [recinto] of property [privada-] still closed to the expected of the since of a view legal measures for this same Tuesday in the that is must analyse the legality of the evacuation of this brave
Some of the demonstrators IDPs to there [portaban] and [repartían] to these hours copies of that order legal and even the [entregaban] to the players that [custodiaban] the place what that resulted &apos; some small clashes &apos; pressed [Bray] who deplored that some official [propinaron] old-fashioned to the demonstrators
The order legal [prohibe] to the authorities [desalojar] to the Member of [Ocupa] Wall Street or apply &apos; laws that is [publicaron] after of that mismanage the occupation or ban to the demonstrators access of new the park with shops or other properties that were previously &apos;
The Mayor [Bloomberg] pressed to the press that because to that order legal the city had suspended the [reapertura] of space the public and to the demonstrators to the that alerted without However that the laws local not them it their to on with shops of campaign and sacks of ball
The [regidor] campaigned personally the [desalojo] taken to out of brave of the place [Zuccotti] a operation in the that is were to around of 200 arrests and that is decided because the demonstrators were &apos; violations the law &apos;
[Bloomberg] he that was the order of [evacuar] the place because this is was becoming &apos; in a place in the that the people not [venÍan] to protest but to all the laws and in some cases to do damage to other people &apos; already that &apos; some business [habÍan] received threats &apos; and the neighbours [temÍan] &apos; by their quality of life &apos;
&apos; The [desalojo] of this brave was [asqueroso] and shows that in the fund [Bloomberg] is more interested in preserving the interests financial that the of the workers Americans &apos; added the spokesman of movement who was the mayor of &apos; [faltar] the respect to the freedom of expression &apos;
The for of &apos; [Ocupa] Wall Street &apos; [indicaron] also that think organise &apos; large actions &apos; to the Thursday in cooperation with organisations Community and unions to commemorate the two months that removal the protests that started the 17 of September

Japan [renace] after the earthquake
The GDP overall a 1 5 % thanks the consumption helping and being end to the spiral of [caídas] that set in March
Since the last month of March the economy macroeconomic is was Why still [convaleciente] by the devastating earthquake that [devino] in a crisis nuclear the worst disaster that [padeció] the country [nipón] since the II War World
The first estimates of government of [Tokio] [cifraron] the losses materials in 300 000 million of dollars a coup that despite the difficult context world seems have [atenuado]
After of three quarters [consecutivos] of [caídas] the fact the [Producto] Interior [Bruto] between July and September was for to Indeed definitively : the GDP is [incrementó] a 1 5 % in compared with the quarter previous and a 6 % in rate [anualizada]
The reported in the second quarter - to the Japanese the year tax beginning in March of 2012 - is also the greater pace of growth from the period of January to March of 2010
The recovery is explains in part by the [repunte] of the buying of machinery for restored the areas [asoladas] by the [seísmo] and the both tsunami
In fact the companies by their investments in a 1 1 % with the declining of 0 9 % in expenses of capital that is observed of January to March the first been after of six months of startling [ininterrumpidas]
However However the real [revulsivo] of the economy macroeconomic not is on exclusively in the momentum - that taught to take the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructure [servirse] of the shortcomings to grow from zero
Japan has reawakened on all thanks to the development of consumption helping that in the currently represents the 60 % of GDP [japonés]
This one [escaló] a 1 % [empujada] by the increase of expenditure in vehicles travel and activities of leisure
The stigma of [yen]
[Tokio] is has [encomendado] the market internal when the [yen] - the currency [nipona] - is has become in one of the &apos; values refuge &apos; [escogidos] by the investors that fleeing of the crisis of debt in the area euro and the top-class forecasts of US US a privileged that is as a [losa] in the accounts of the companies [exportadoras]
With a motto more strong the products are more expensive in the abroad a seriously precisely for a country whose line of [flotación] economic next certain by the health of the large groups technological

And in effect the prospects not are encouraging
The Organisation to the Cooperation and the Development Economic ( OECD ) [precisó] that the most of the countries Member tabled in September signs more [nítidos] of squarely economic

The that of that the &apos; consensus &apos; the new government of transition [heleno] next more tax by the demands of Brussels that by a right-of-centre convincing of the forces policies beginning to permanently with facts
While the new first minister [Lukas] [Papadimos] [advertía] yesterday that not there alternative to the reforms structural and that the period of hundred days agreed in their designation perhaps is it short to implement the leader of party Conservative New Democracy [Antonis] [Samaras] [aseguraba] that not [respaldará] new measures of austerity in no case and [reiteró] their demand of new elections for the date measures the 19 of February
&apos; The main task of this government is apply the decisions of the summit of 26 of October &apos; [aseveró] [Papadimos] the open yesterday a debate parliamentary that at morning with a vote of confidence the new Executive

However However the message of [Samaras] not [despeja] the doubt on their position : &apos; We have committed to help the government of transition but not we have committed to nothing more &apos;
The leader Conservative was a [pasito] more far in their [pulso] to the EU and the IMF the bodies that must [desbloquear] the 8 000 million that Athens needs with urgent and with clear that not will their seen good to no letter of compromise of get of the adjustments
But the Commission European [escocida] still by the impact caused by the [órdago] the referendum of [Papandreu] [reiteró] yesterday that their demand is firm : not [desbloqueará] the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main parties [helenos] not [firman] &apos; a compromise writing without ambiguity and what before possible &apos;

So Their [Majestad] he that is is to that to end of 2015 are handled the million of families poor that have [accedido] to these services financial and that hundred million of those who out the threshold of poverty in the that are ragamuffin
The momentum in the view of the [microcréditos] in Spain and in the rest the world &apos; has followed the schedule must ago years of way Europe &apos; by [Muhammad] [Yunus] [resalto] [Doña] Sofia as a &apos; act of justice and recognition because &apos;

In this sense an that be a mistake link the cooperation with [paises] in to of development to [épocas] of [bonanza] economic already that is a &apos; duty permanent &apos;

The badge proposes choose the President European by suffrage universal
The first day the conference of the Union [Cristiano-demócrata] ( badge ) the Monday 14 of November in thumbs has so without large difficulties to withdraw withdraw Chancellor and President of party [cristiano-demócrata]
Initially not is had including in the order the day the future of Europe but the issue is imposed in autumn in particular for satisfy to the fighters that they that the policy of government is currently too little strict with the who and could become in a future with the Italian
The motion on the Presidency of the Commission European proposal by the direction is adopted virtually by unanimity
In the 1 [001] naturally so only is condemnation nine votes in against and ten [abstenciones]
The [standing] [ovation] of several minutes that is [ganaron] with their speeches withdraw withdraw and after several hours [Wolfgang] [Schäuble] the [eurófilo] Minister of mint [despejan] any doubt possible
The idea key of the Chancellor and of the motion is short in a slogan : the answer to the crisis &apos; not is least Europe but more Europe &apos;
not only because Europe is the peace but also because &apos; nine million of jobs on directly the euro &apos;
For the Chancellor &apos; has come the time of open way in Europe &apos;
This could votes in amendments of Treaty of Lisbon to allow strengthen the control of the Union European on the policies budgetary of the countries of the area the euro but also could [desembocar] in the election the President of the Commission European by suffrage universal for &apos; you a face to Europe &apos;
In all case that is a of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress clearly idea of [Wolfgang] [Schäuble]
However doubt is little likely that the 27 shall quickly to a agreement on this change radical : Britain Britain is shows hostile to him and the leaders of the badge seem know that [Nicolas] Sarkozy also
But the accept is on the ground
is other hand the naturally have rejected by a majority won the proposal of [ponderar] the weight of each country of the directive of Bank Central European in role the weight of each economy what which obviously [reforzaría] the weight of Germany
[Ansiosa] by [calmar] the encouraged in the internal of their party the Chancellor has increased the no to Konrad [Adenauer] and [Helmut] [Kohl] But not is that has tried who to their conference to at of the &apos; small &apos; countries European or of the countries in difficulties prepared to criticise to the byword Germany
Although the motion on Europe he a paragraph to the importance of &apos; the friendship [franco-alemana] &apos; withdraw withdraw not has [mentado] to France
[Salvo] of last
Thinking that ago two centuries is in a bloody battle in thumbs
In fact was a of the [derrotas] more humiliating to the army of Rostopchine
The impact of fraud in the in by disease
After the benefits the [UMP] and the government [emprenden] a for against the in by disease
[Nicolas] his will the Tuesday 15 of November in from to visit a box for of the benefits family and use a speech on the issue already recurrent since 2007 of the fight against the fraud social and the [ayudantía]
In for - such for that part of the will of save of way thorough but still so reminds to a which of the campaign presidential of right the most to Firstly in the in by disease
In first place for apply cuts budgetary : the government for on to the workers of sector private a quarter day of we before of power take the low
In final unless that there a convention of company specific a worker that [caiga] ill [perdería] four days of wage is say a minimum of 15 % of their income month
It is of a measure that could on a wave of [ira] but that would save [280] million of EUR according them [Echos]
In would accompanied of other measure with a reach more symbolic : on to the officials a day of we without remains in case of low labour ( to the time not have we with to the three days that is apply in the sector private )
While is [debaten] these issues the majority again to to on the table also the issue the fraud this time looking towards the abuses of the in working
&apos; Van to [incrementarse] significantly the controls and also if is which to someone planned a fraud must [reembolsar] the [cuantías] &apos; emergency [Xavier] [Bertrand] talking in the [RTL] the Sunday 13 of November
At as that in the other cases the effects the announcement seem slightly [desproporcionados] for the reality of fraud in on of in labour
In fact from 2002 is for a monitoring constant of this issue and is have it various offensive policies that normally have given emerged
The French not [enferman] more that in the rest of Europe
handed with attention in first place the figures national
According the Institute French of the safety social ( [CNAM] ) in 2006 is [abonaron] more of [237] million of EUR in particular by in labour
According the Institute French of research and In in economy of the health the benefits by the in [representaron] in 2008 the 5 % the expenditure health [ascendiendo] to 11 300 million of EUR
In this sum the 46 % is to the in by leave and by accidents labour while that the 54 % is related with the in by disease figure that out to 6 200 million of EUR
is therefore the 2 5 % the expenditure in health
In 2010 the French have [cogido] a average of 14 5 days of low labour with to 17 8 in 2009 according a study of group [Alma] [Consulting]
A average that without doubt behind government : other survey published in 2007 by the Syrian of management professional [Monster] [com] [mostraba] that the 75 % of the 40 000 workers French [encuestados] rushing that not had [cogido] or a only day of low by disease
Another study in this case of the [Assurance] [maladie] points that in 2010 the 37 % of the in by disease had a long-term from to 8 days the 22 % of between 8 and 14 days the 15 % of between 15 days and a month the 15 % of between one and three months and the 11 % were more extended
If the compared with our neighbours European the workers French not are more [propensos] that in other areas to take in by disease
A long study done in 2010 by two researchers of [CNRS] planning that between 1994 and 2001 the rate of lack global of work ( therefore by reasons of health as of another kind ) [oscilaba] in France between the 10 % and the 11 % with to a 20 % and a 28 % in Denmark a 15 % in UK UK or between a 16 % and a 18 % in the Netherlands Netherlands
The fraud in the in by disease not is particularly significant in compared with the work not declared
The fraud has a reach quite limited
The forward of the legislation since 2002 has caused that the controls of the in by disease of more of 45 days are [sistemáticos]
In 2008 of 1 5 million of inspections the [CNAM] [comprobó] in a 13 % of the [285] 000 made that the in of shorter long-term were &apos; gaps or too long &apos; is say 37 [050] cases
In the case of the in of more of 45 days further to inspections [sistemáticas] is was that the 11 % of the cases were &apos; rightly [adaptados] or [injustificados] ; a figure that taking as starting a total of 1 2 million out to preliminary 000
is therefore is high a total of 169 000 cases &apos; [injustificados] &apos; between several million of workers that [cogieron] a low by disease
However doubt a figure minor in compared by example with the work in black
According the Member of the [UMP] [Dominique] [Tian] author of a report on this question in June this practice will a losses of income tax of between 9 000 and 15 000 million of EUR the year is say more that the cost total of the benefits by in and without doubt significantly more that the fraud in this last area

Policy energy :
the facts must assert more that the undistorted
If there a issue that not is can try taking in account considerations of short term or simply thinking in the emotion is the policy energy
The availability and the cost of the electricity on directly in the power purchasing and in the competitiveness of the companies
is appropriate that a I electoral be the time of think on such issues and on the place of the energy nuclear
The debate only will useful if investigated the whole of the consequences economic social and environmental of the options proposals
The French must Reform their opinion in facts objectives in data rational
now that are 7 000 million of people in the planet the development demographic plus the duplication of the demand electricity before of 2050 to least that is [prive] to a huge part of the population world of a element vital
At same time will that unsustainability the shortage each time greater of the resources fossil to to have electricity continually without forget the [imperiosa] need of reduce the emissions of gases of effect greenhouse to fight against the change climate a issue that has disappeared of debate ecological
The accident of [Fukushima] not change none of these parameters
is that Germany away single in their decision of up to the energy nuclear
That not is the case or of Belgium that hearing the their to the need of find a source capable of [sustituirla] or of Switzerland that only has by aim build central of last generation
is other hand Britain Britain Finland Poland Republic Czech Netherlands Netherlands Sweden Africa China India and Brazil by quote some examples are forward with determination with their projects
The States United by their hand after [Fukushima] &apos;s add a unit to their park [retomando] the construction of a central [interrumpida] after the accident of [Three] [Mile] [Island]
If the model German based in the energy renewable is is in times as example the reality is in against of such speech
The election of Berlin is to mean a [encarecimiento] of price of the electricity a greater on energy by the need [incrementada] of gas imported in particular of Russia a increase of the emissions of CO2 by the construction of central of gas and of coal
In a months is [notarán] the effects harmful
must [meditarse] on the case of Denmark
[Campeón] of Europe in the sector [eólico] of which this the 30 % of their electricity also is one of the large users of coal and of gas because to the [intermitencia] of wind ; by this reason their emissions of CO2 and the price of their electricity are respectively a 65 % and a 50 % more high that the average European
is the contrary thanks to the have of our policy energy our neighbours [abonan] a bill of electricity a 40 % higher to the of the who French
Meanwhile that in a economy restructurings the cost of the energy is a factor key of the competitiveness and a guarantee the it of the usefulness industrial in the territory national the companies French is benefit of the electricity more cheap of Europe
is that reason any reduction significantly of the energy nuclear contribute a strong takes the price of the electricity what that [restaría] realism to the [maravillosas] statements on the [reindustrialización] of our country and the defence of our power purchasing
It is of a price that the great majority of the French is refuse to pay and of fact not [manifiestan] opposition by principle to this kind of energy according show the out
us that the policy energy of our country has lost build a sector industrial with twenty-five 000 jobs of work director and [410] 000 jobs [indirectos]
[Ampliamente] looking to the export encompasses a galaxy of [pymes] specialist in the markets international and that can create jobs not [deslocalizables]
If France [decidiese] leave the energy nuclear contribute the [sacrificio] of great part of these SMEs and the loss of the 6 000 million of EUR year in exports French of equipment and services nuclear
it What [electricista] [encargaría] a [EPR] designed to work Sixty years when is to the collapse of their manufacturer
For right the equation of the energy nuclear there that admit that not is a source miracle of production of electricity the as that not is a source [diabólica]
The development by part of [Areva] of solutions with in emissions of CO2 nuclear and renewable shows the nature also of the sources of energy
In the case of the energy nuclear is essential keep the maximum level of safety
In France have of a Authority of security that has a control narrower and transparent therefore on the central existing as on the construction of [Flamanville]
Our equipment of recognised professionalism are also obsessed by the security
In a century the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious
Only only one the of [Three] [Mile] [Island] is in in a conditions operational normal ; not resulted consequences or to the people or to the a environment
In Chernobyl the accident is was the design the sink and to a failures human [imperdonables]
In [Fukushima] some people seem forget that the accident is was to two disasters natural of a reach without an that wave the death of tens of thousands of people
The sector nuclear [aprenderá] of this accident such as what was of the two previous
you to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security and the operators and seating French and Germans the [EPR] is a design capable of [resistir] to such phenomena
While what [estudian] all the players electric that want build a central the with of their construction in [Flamanville] be a great gift for the competitors of [Areva] and [EDF] since that them nonetheless to free for in the leadership in the inevitable development the sector nuclear
is essential and legitimate to the best options [energéticas] to our country but be irresponsible to that the taught the dogmas and the volume [partisanas] [dominasen] a debate so important for the situation economic social and financial of our country
The immigration it a burden or a opportunity to the economy
The policy of immigration roundly by [Nicolas] Sarkozy has been [criticada] that from various points of view : the [saturación] of the services police judicial and administrative subject to the policy of figures the compatibility of this policy with the status [autoproclamado] of &apos; country of the rights human &apos; of France
than recently is the harassment administrative of the students foreign the that has [saltado] to the headlines with the Minister of Interior ( [véase] the newspaper [Libération] of 23 of May ) [proclamando] of last that France &apos; not needs [talentos] foreign workers or [camareros] &apos;
However However rarely time is analysing from the point of view economic
The question is that on this issue there quite consensus between the left and the right
In the case of the right Jacques Chirac [fijó] the it [declarando] in 1976 that &apos; 900 000 unemployed not should be a problem to a country that account with close of two million of workers immigrants &apos; while that in the left the tone what [fijó] Michel Rocard [explicando] that France &apos; not can done office of whole the misery the world &apos; in 1990
The only difference the degree of generosity
In 2005 therefore the left as the right [compartían] the fear to the invasion of territory national by a a of [fontaneros] Poles
to both both is as that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society French
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with the that act with regard to the immigrants
In their programme &apos; [Hollande] is limited to include [banalidades] those that the [codesarrollo] will right the &apos; problem of the migration &apos;
This idea of the immigration as a burden a problem perhaps is why [electoralmente] but economically its very face
As as guarding the economists Party [Goldin] and [Geoffrey] square in a labour recent that sums the knowledge more recent on the immigration ( [Exceptional] [People] : [How] [Migration] [Shaped] [Our] World and [Will] [Define] [Our] [Future] May of 2011 [Princeton] University reporter [352] [pp] ) is a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive of the flows migratory in the growth economic the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants
The restrict of the immigration it the growth and also the employment
The fears related with the impact of the immigrants is based in the idea of that these can replace to the workers national in particular to the little qualified pressing to that is reduce their wages
But the experience shows that in reality the immigrants are more well additional that substitutes of the workers national and use mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment
The immigrants little qualified working in sectors that not by to workers national and the more qualified in sectors dynamic where the training not This the demand of personal
A effect positive on the wages
From same way that a surgeon would difficulties to work in a country that have lack of [anestesistas] the [complementariedad] between national and immigrants from that the arrival of these last chance welcome in the wages and the employment of the national
mind in account what previous [Giovanni] [Peri] [calculó] that a increase of 1 % of the flows migratory is a takes of the wages real to long term of between a 0 6 and a 0 9 %
And without have in account the fact of that the diversity that [aportan] the immigrants helps to the creation of ideas and the growth economic ( is a great proportion of prizes Nobel Americans [naturalizados] and companies as Google [Intel] [Paypal] [eBay] and Yahoo were well-founded by immigrants )
The immigrants also are taxpayers dig to the systems social since that [aportan] of average a 1 % of budget total in the countries European
The Organisation International of unemployment estimated by example that in Germany a immigrant that it with a age of 30 years operators a contribution [neta] ( income least expenses ) of 150 000 EUR to the budgets public of average for whole their life
At principle of their mandate [Nicolas] Sarkozy wanted go to to the points of growth that to [faltaban] &apos; with the European &apos;
which European that [disuadieron] to the immigrants had exactly the effect race
Europe invented the democracy only to lack think in a democracy European
The democracy is a well precious but also fragile
The continent European should power [acordarse] of this already that but is invented in Athens ago more of two thousand years to what long the century 20th has suffered the tragedies of the War World [totalitarismos] the Holocaust the exalted but also to Franco in Spain to tobacco-production in Portugal the [coroneles] in Greece
Some perhaps up that for that the democracy [triunfase] definitively on their enemies be enough exercise the vote and the way more direct possible
know from Rostopchine &apos; the [Pequeño] &apos; that is was of something considered
The suffrage universal but is is of a condition necessary to the democracy not is enough by itself only and even can become in a &apos; instrument of oppression &apos; as said found the [filósofo] [republicano] [Etienne] [Vacherot]
not the democracy required a more : a space public a spirit public values a organisation a separation and a control of the powers a education [Luces] solidarity economic and social justice
The crisis that we in Europe is a crisis economic but is to point of become in a crisis policy and democratic
The [palinodia] the referendum Greek [verdadero-falso] had to this regard a double effect intend : was the need of a return take of the sphere policy but also the worrying that of their Alternatively of their inconsistency
must [reflexionarse] on this ambivalence for [superarla]
The truth is that the lines of with of the battle democratic currently is have [desplazado] and that in many cases the soldiers Republican already not progress in the good sense
not [saldremos] gaining if We a succession of referenda national organised in role of the needs and of way [desordenada]
A signing in white the [monarca] European all or a high the gap of hole [nacionalista] : ! what options to the citizen !
not not want from old-fashioned of effect but a exercise common of full right relaxed and continuous of the options and the democracy this time to level European
not there crisis in Greece Italy Spain Portugal ( of fact not [sabríamos] where end the list ) because only there a crisis the crisis of Europe
The whole of Europe is the that is [pliega] to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of rating that the that unaccompanied their of and their lack of solidarity
is the whole of Europe the that suffering a humiliation in the sphere international
We preaching by the transfer of sovereignty to Europe but is whole Europe the that lose slowly the sovereignty and with it every a of their nations
What more urgent is that the sovereignty popular ’ the helm of project European
Because only together will the European reduce the weight of their debts shake of the markets and preparation their future by the investments
The exit of the crisis multi-faceted decisions to level European that not will factored without a legitimacy democratic total unless that be for [conducirnos] the disaster
After have fought for a time against this proposal of the socialists and of Jacques Delors all the world calls in the currently a governance economic European
can so be
But think in it without a greater integration policy and democratic and without that be [vivida] as such by the citizens be a new madness and we would to a new point died
must in a new stage of the construction European
For build the Republic in France was be &apos; do &apos; Republican
The Revolution motivated by interests not be enough
This lesson still being applies
must build a Europe more integrated from the point of view economic
was is will achieve pursuing a Europe more democratic in the level political a real sovereignty popular European
For build Europe us European

From usual to Nigeria the with terrorist is in increase
Paris is concerned by the links between At al-Qaeda in the [Magreb] Islamic and the [secta] [Boko] [Haram]
The links between the group terrorist At al-Qaeda in the [Magreb] Islamic ( [Aqmi] ) and the [secta] Nigerian of [Boko] [Haram] on the that is [sospechaba] since ago time is have confirmed
The Sunday the [Viceministro] [argelino] of Affairs Foreign [Abdelkader] [Messahel] even said that [Argel] already &apos; has the [certidumbre] &apos;
&apos; The way in that both organisations operating and the reports of the services of intelligence shown that are [cooperando] &apos; he without they more details
Paris seems to to a conclusion similar
The research on the hostages of two French in ex-post the last January have pursued the [pasarelas]
[Raptados] in a restaurant of [Niamey] by people relating with [Aqmi] [Antoine] of [Léocour] and [Vincent] [Delory] killed the day next with with several of their [secuestradores] during a operation replaces by the forces special French
In the rubble of the intervention the researchers French and custody abused several [chips] [telefónicos] that been to the terrorists
[Eje] terrorist
The study of the so-called made points towards several partners based in [Mali] ex-post and Nigeria
According Radio France [Internationale] ( [RFI] ) two numbers [captaron] particularly the interest of the researchers : one leads to a [nigeriano] that [permaneció] for a time in [Maiduguri] a city the north of Nigeria cradle of [Boko] [Haram] and the other to a man that supposed is have to [Aqmi] and to the [secta]
&apos; It is of a progress but without doubt we wait to [poseer] tests more formal before of about of cooperation operational between [Aqmi] and [Boko] [Haram] &apos;
&apos; But is possible &apos;
&apos; know from ago years that the [secta] they of support financial and intellectual foreign and that each time is more active &apos; says [Kunle] [Amuwo] a scientists [nigeriano]
These last months these &apos; support &apos; had result each time more clear in the development and the speeches of [Boko] [Haram] or in their case operational that now Modern the use of [kamikazes] or equipment explosives each time more complex and the same lifestyle that the category by [Aqmi]
The community international beginning by Washington is from then pressing to [Abuya] to that have in account the problems have by [Boko] [Haram]
The authorities sympathetic of fact are time considering the group as a community of [iluminados] little understandable of interest
A success quickly
[Fundada] in 2002 in [Maiduguri] in about to a [mezquita] a school and the magnet [fundamentalista] Mohammed [Yusuf] [Boko] [Haram] ( that means in [hausa] &apos; the education Western is a [pecado] &apos; ) self-harm to the both of a [emirato] Islamic in the north Muslim of Nigeria
In this region poor the partnership is living a success quickly
It [politiza] and requires a respect narrower of the Sharia while that their fighters is within to the fight against the government central [impío]
These last is [orientan] in first place to the churches the televisions the administrations
In 2009 the fighters of [Boko] [Haram] were particularly active and is [multiplicaron] the attacks against the [comisarías]
The reaction of [Abuya] was as is to widespread
The army [atacó] the city and is condemnation 800 dead
Mohammed [Yusuf] arrested in life In the death in prison
Since then the [secta] is [radicaliza] and or their [feudos] of north
The past their eye a attack that cause 80 dead in [Jos] and after another in [Abuya]
In June [Boko] [Haram] again to attack against [Abuya] in particular against the Álava general constitutionally of the police with a attack suicidal the first of this kind
In August the based local of the Nations UN is becomes in their first aim international

The world according the candidates Republican to the Presidency
In relationship with China with Iran and with the aid to Israel [Mitt] [Romney] [Herman] [Cain] and [Rick] [Perry] vying in [simpleza] and lack of knowledge
A America [debilitada] by the crisis it can manage a world complex with ideas simple or even [simplistas]
[Escuchando] to the candidates Republican to the presidential the electorate could think that so is
Since ago a days [Mitt] [Romney] [Herman] [Cain] [Rick] [Perry] and the other candidates each time do more statements [estruendosas] and [atajos] in on of policy foreign traditionally a point strong of the Republican
It [extienden] the [lemas] to often [infundamentados] on China Iran the aid to Israel
[Mitt] [Romney] the candidate better has in the career towards the designation by the &apos; Cardiff [Old] [Party] &apos; has threatened with to to the Chinese to the WTO and [denunciarles] &apos; by manipulation of their motto &apos; a issue key in a America [exasperada] by the migration of [fragmentos] uncontrolled of their sector towards Asia
are as if that means the explosion of a war trade said
[Jon] [Huntsman] former ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate that has a vision [sofisticada] of the policy foreign almost is [ahoga] to a attitude that &apos; [apabulla] &apos; the emotion
has asked a dialogue firm but parity with Beijing ( the position current of Obama )
But [Huntsman] that is is plateau in the Tipperary of the polls still being [inaudible]
At lifestyle of Ronald
[Romney] also has promised a intervention military in Iran if the sanctions not peer Those their programme nuclear
&apos; If [salgo] elected [detendré] to Iran &apos; [fanfarroneó]
&apos; If Obama its his have the bomb &apos;
[Prometió] also increase the aid military to Israel [acusando] to Obama of have failed with their obligations in relationship with that partner
The his [Herman] [Cain] the second candidate better life-style shows by their part a knowledge embarrassing of such subjects
Recently [instaba] to to to the threat military Chinese because Beijing &apos; is develop capacity nuclear &apos; is her the fact of that China already at the [átomo] military from 1964
The Governor [tejano] [Rick] [Perry] that supports to Israel and to intervene in Iran says that by their part is prepared to deploy the army US in Mexico to fight against the which of the drugs
The appeal to the torture against the supposed terrorists ban by Obama in 2009 also what [preconizan] [Cain] [Perry] and the Mayor [Michele] [Bachmann]
The differences are considerable with the candidate [republicano] of 2008 John [McCain] a weight heavy in policy foreign
The opponents of current President [contestan] that Ronald also had ideas simple and that won the War Cold
[Recuerdan] that the own Obama was a amateur and that had that [aflojar] the single-engine in on of fight against the terrorism
[Insisten] with reason in the failure of their [ingenuo] dialogue with Iran in the exit hurried of the &apos; [boys] &apos; of Iraq and in their [tergiversaciones] in Libya and what [etiquetan] of weak
But the attacks not them are simple
The population [juzga] of a way more well positive the balance of safety national of Obama that is with thirty-nine-year-old Laden

The [Nord] Stream new door of entry of gas Russian in Europe
The pipeline [Nord] Stream that [comunica] directly Europe Western with Russia happening by the fund of Sea Baltic already is has since in service
must supply gas to satisfy the needs of 30 million of who
Gazprom the heralded Russian of gas has wanted there the event with great [pompa]
The last Tuesday more of 500 invited including four Heads of state and of government took to on of Baltic between the music of the [orquesta] and a delicate [bufet] in the opening of [Nord] Stream the new pipeline that [comunica] directly under the sea Russia with Germany
[Simbólicamente] the Chancellor German withdraw withdraw the President Russian Dmitri indication the Prime Minister French &apos; [Fillon] and their counterpart of the Netherlands Netherlands Mark [Rutte] have [girado] together the [volante] of the [válvula] that controls the entry of gas Russian in the network of Europe Western
With this new pipeline each year Whether 27 5 million of metres solid of gas Russian additional to Europe Western to through of a first had of 1 [224] km that [comunican] the region of St Petersburg with the [Land] of [Mecklemburgo-Pomerania]
A Secondly [tubo] should [concluirse] to end of 2012 that will supply a total of 55 000 million of metres solid of gas is say enough to cover all the consumption French
In already is about of the possibility of build a third [tubo] by the same way
For Gazprom the completion to time of this huge labour is [aires] of victory
Poland and the countries Baltic is had theories strongly the project
In fact the [Nord] Stream is to allow supply gas directly to Germany any the course earth by third countries ( Poland and Ukraine )
In coup these two countries Some something of their power : to them will more difficult influence in Russia [amenazándola] with [cerrarle] the access to the markets of Europe Western
In the point [álgido] of debate Warsaw not [dudó] in comparisons the [Nord] Stream as a &apos; new pact [germano-soviético] &apos; in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for should Poland in [1939]
is say if the issue is politically delicate
Europe Western support the project Russian has successful a greater security of supply
But the price is a weakening of the Europe of the energy given that the project has led a gap between the European of this and the dressed
Russia has known in so only five years do [triunfar] their vision of a alliance direct between Russia and the countries Western rich large consumers of gas and with a reserves each time more limited
&apos; This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia a new [arteria] that us unite of way growers &apos; this &apos; [Fillon] for the opening the pipeline proving to what point the large contracts the sector of gas are so political as economic
all this explains the broad smiles in the sides of the toxic of Gazprom many in [Lubmin] in the point of arrival of gas
The construction of this pipeline also is a achievement technical
The [tubo] [submarino] is made of steel [recubierto] of rebuild for [protegerlo] against the [anclas] of the ships
It supports in the fund the sea to a average of 200 values of depth
For [construirlo] was necessary avoid camps of mines that rim of the Second War World
&apos; was necessary with or destroy a [centena] of them by caution &apos; out [Jens] [Müller] spokesman of the society [Nord] Stream
also s necessary providing the measures of protection of the supervise and the flora
The [tubo] is a long snake-heads of metal that is as 242 [torres] [Eiffel] and not is interrupted in whole their length : or by [válvulas] or by stations of it
was measures a platform of control in the waters of Sweden but the for the project [renunciaron] to the same the see that the Swedish not were very prepared to allow that a society state Russian is [estableciera] of way permanent in the sea with to their coast
&apos; In case of [avería] [interrumpiremos] the step of gas in least of a minute &apos; precise [Jens] [Müller]
In case of flight the gas the pipeline is [liberará] by therefore to the atmosphere
But the seating they little likely that is would a flight since that have to [junturas] that according the forecasts have a flight every 100 000 years
The control the state the pipeline is an by a robot [submarino] [arrastrado] by a per that for inspections external so as by a has that reasons by the internal of pipeline
With the way of a pure is predictability in the internal of [tubo] that has a distance of a metre and is all with the gas
to their arrival after three hours minutes of journey to a speed of three metres by second except data precise on possible [deformaciones] of metal
The pipeline has been designed to work during fifty years without need of any kind of [reparación]
The movement the gas is an simply by the pressure
At principle is of 200 [bars] and to the exit of 100 [bars]
Five companies have joined their forces for power to to out this project
The company leader is Gazprom that has the 51 % of the participating
to it is [unieron] the German E [ON] and [BASF] ( 15 5 % each a ) so as the reporting [Gasunie] and the group French [GDF] [Suez] ( 9 % each one )
These five societies have created a company common so-called [Nord] Stream that of build and exploiting the pipeline
It their based in [Zoug] Switzerland where the forcing is particularly favourable
After Gazprom [alquiló] to this society for a term of 25 years renewable the whole of the capacities of transport of gas
&apos; to Gazprom to payments by the ability total regardless of the amount of gas that really is transport &apos; precise [Jens] [Müller]
The funding of the construction the pipeline is has taken just in a 30 % with the contribution of the [accionistas] and in a 70 % by loans banking
The cost total of the labour should achieve 7 400 million of EUR to the two [tubos]
For [GDF] [Suez] by example the investment has reached the [240] million
But the [accionistas] weaker are insurance of that not [superarán] their investment since that Gazprom moderating by itself only the risk of the expenses
The pipeline [emerge] of Baltic in [Lubmin] in a at [arenosa] [plantada] of [pinos]
for [válvulas] with 4 5 metres of level form the door of exit of gas
are a sensors that [miden] the pressure the temperature and the characteristics specific the gas to the arrival before of that is owed to the gas Germans
Since the last Tuesday the terminal In a million of metres solid of gas Russian every time
to total capacity be three million by time and in 2012 six million
[Moleskine] a [libreta] of mark
[Creada] ago a century by a company Italian [Moleskine] to restore to the people the will by the [escritura]

The [libreta] [Moleskine] is recognised easily with their solder [rectangulares] blackest their notes their [hojas] of colour white it as [envejecidas] by the time
However However the [libretas] [Moleskine] with the aspect current born in 1997
The company Italian [Modo] [Modo] based in Milan decided in time time launch the market a [libreta] of answering of design but [distinguida]
[Maria] [Sebregondi] by time then [consultora] of the company is Musicians of launching the new product
The [libreta] is have in a former technical of production the [mole] [skin] ( fur of [topo] ) that is concerns to a by [barnizado] that is his between other things for cover the [banquetas]
This kind of [libreta] was very valued by the writers and the passenger
&apos; [Moleskine] has [adaptado] the will current a subject old and neglected a [icono] of the artists [vanguardistas] to the century 20th &apos; account [Maria] [Sebregondi] that since then is became in for of the mark in [Modo] [Modo]
And Karlsbad the success
Among 2006 and 2010 the sales by in a 26 % to achieve a volume of 12 7 million of units [vendidas]
consideration has been the production confidential of the first years in the that only is planned 3 000 [libretas]
[Moleskine] is more beyond of the borders Italian and exported their products to 70 countries since France to States United
is difficult The the profile the one since that the [cuaderno] of answering attracts therefore to men of business as to students and professionals
At as that [Moleskine] their users are [cosmopolitas] of spirit open and experiences
The small company Italian that had with twelve workers in their at now has close of 100 and since 2008 has two offices : a in Milan and the other in New York
[Distribuye] their [cuadernos] in bookshops since the [Fnac] to the small shops the centre of the cities and has known on their identity
&apos; We we [adaptado] to the times and to the need of write to despite the on of the post electronic &apos; explains [Maria] [Sebregondi]
This signing cultural is of the hand with the development of [Moleskine] : recently the mark has it the statement &apos; [Detour] &apos; where architects or artists psychologically their own [cuaderno]
In August launched also a [cuaderno] with [tapas] of [leopardo] with reason the festival of cinema of [Locarno]
were their success and this [aura] cultural [Moleskine] has known been their products : [bolsos] acts [bolígrafos] [fundas] of computer The mark encompasses a wider range of [soportes]
A success that from [envidia] : in autumn of 2006 [Modo] [Modo] was acquired by the fund of investment [SG] capital Europe in the currently [Syntegra] capital [escribiéndose] so a new Indeed in the history of [Moleskine]
it is what the rate of unemployment of the workers disabled still being so higher
manufacturing of 19 % of the people with are for a employment
The [XV] Week for the employment of the disabled starts today
to despite of a policy public settled roundly since 2005 the rate of unemployment between the people with greater the rate average : a 19 % with the 9 % to the whole of the population
it [Desalentadora]
&apos; not &apos; says [Éric] [Blanchet] director general of [Adapt] the partnership that &quot; the week to the employment of the disabled
&apos; The progress infrastructural since ago fifteen years are considerable
&apos; In time then the rate of unemployment not was two times but three times more higher that the average
&apos; However However still is great by do &apos;
One mention that the unemployed disabled are alike to many obstacles to access the employment
inhumane have a age more elderly : the 37 % has more of 50 years ( a 17 % of average )
[Poseen] a level of jobs little high : the 80 % not has over the [bachillerato] and of the 2 3 million of students in the education higher so only 10 000 are disabled
is last the unemployment of long long-term is very widespread between them : the 53 % to the disabled with the 38 % of average
is say are many issues that [dificultan] particularly the return the world labour and that &apos; are the [quid] of problem &apos; out [Christian] [Grapin] director general of [Tremplin] a partnership created in 1992 to help to the companies to you workers disabled
These are the obstacles objectives
In are those that not is mention ; the mentality of the people is but too slowly
A study done in April by the partnership [IMS-Entreprendre] to the [Cité] that that the directors [encuestados] have &apos; a level of knowledge on the safely under &apos; with a &apos; representation excessive of the people in wheelchair of wheelchair [deficientes] physical or intellectuals &apos;
The result : the companies private with more of 20 workers are very far the aim of you a 6 % of workers disabled aim that is [fijó] in a law of 1987
According the last figures available that rim of 2008 at a relationship of 2 6 %
&apos; now on in about the 3 % &apos; out Pierre Mont-Blanc director general of [Agefiph] the body The of tax-raising the contributions of the companies that not climate-friendly this law
The test : the number of establishment &apos; subject to this contribution &apos; the as that the [cuantías] [desembolsadas] have has between 2007 and 2011 happening of 59 000 to 46 000 structures ( and of [606] to [480] million of EUR )
&apos; The law of 2005 that [aumentaba] the contributions has led a great pressure to the companies &apos; explains Pierre Mont-Blanc
&apos; But this improvement also reflects a real [concienciación] in particular between the large groups &apos;
According the Ministry of unemployment so only the 59 % of the societies that they between 20 and 49 workers account with employees disabled in their [plantilla] with the was % of the companies of between 100 and [199] workers
