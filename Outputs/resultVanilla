numerous daily of a child [obeso] not [desayuna] and dinner pieces
more of a third of the children with age percentage between the 9 and 13 years have problems of obesity where the obesity affects the 9 of the population school and the obesity the 5
the children overweight from in their majority of families with a lifestyle of life that not is healthy according is from of research current
is again to demonstrate what is the importance the environment where is overall for a development healthy of the person so as the models that serve of reference
in the table the children [obsesos] is fuel for example of pieces the least with the double of often that the children of families with weight normal
for dinner more the 19 of the overweight had [cenado] potatoes [fritas] the day before the analysis the which is linked the programme of prevention apos the obesity not is a [casualidad] apos
in the families of children with obesity not there preparation of people sports what which is applies to the majority of the families current where only the 15 of the children replied that their parents the least a time for week are time for the exercise physical
survey so to 900 children
the survey is was to end the last year school and took in the same almost 900 children of education basic of whole liberec
already was the second edition the programme of apos the obesity of not is a [casualidad] apos that supports the company of sure health general and the company [unilever]
to now have participated in the project more of 12 billion children since the [4º] to the [8º] course
a [dieta] appropriate and quite exercise in family are factors [determinantes] that do decrease a the number of children with obesity and even obesity
apos only the half of the children [encuestados] have would that have five lunches joys according the regime breakfast lunch food [merienda] and dinner that is a of the conditions in for a [dieta] healthy apos other one of the results of the survey
without breakfast but with [embutido] for dinner
the specialists [avisan] of that in a development healthy are important also the details that also have as for example have a time set for the breakfast in family
in liberec not however only the 23 of the families of schoolchildren [desayunan] to the same time
in the majority of the families every one [desayuna] only
but what worst was be that in the 10 of the who not is [desayuna] nothing
the breakfast is without however the basis of a [dieta] day right
the study shows that in the families of children overweight is consume with very more often the [insanas] potatoes [fritas]
almost all regardless the weight they to daily [refrescos] [dulces] 70
for rule general do sport more the 40 of the children [encuestados] without however pronounced their parents this result is reduces to least of the half only the 15
[fabrícate] your [dieta]
the next stage the study [posibilitó] that the [chavales] elected [204] boys and [172] girls of 13 schools is [creasen] their own which to from of all the takeover possible according their tastes and views
apos the entourage food of the children czech in age percentage between the 12 and 15 years since the point of view of a food healthy are very removed of what ideal apos
between their food favourite is are the [pasta] the meat and the [dulces]
apos is on all alarming the popularity of the [refrescos] [dulces] apos is by in the report end the study
as food main is has the palma the [pasta] and you still of close the meat of church
virtually the children reject always the [legumbre] and the will for the fish and the i is very under
change to habits made
the same time the study shows that the children are prepared to change their habits food if receive the information fair
apos in the group of control of the participants in the study that [rellenaron] the [cuestionario] after of end the programme of prevention apos the obesity not is a [casualidad] apos is was in many cases a change important to favour of the principles of a food healthy apos is as in the results the study
way the attention for example what concerning to the [refrescos] [dulces] where many children [empezarían] to [preferir] the water normal and aware
the children also [elegirían] with more often in the [cuestionario] the meat of church and the fish for the food main and [restringirían] the consumption of food fresh and the derivatives of [harina]
the [estilista] has of be also a good psychologist maintain the professionals
in the article [introductorio] how about the [estilistas] already i [quejé] a little of that the lessons initial already were quite [cargadas]
not had not idea of how would what
conferences of three professionals the [ramo] how wear to resolute problem and also a seminar on how works in the world the spectacle
and will worst
as more close are the examinations end more information and tasks practices we [aguardan]
and although the course is develops every saturday and sunday already not is a [alfiler]
we time we examined with the director [alena] in the course not there no man on how wear to the woman that not has a [simetría] perfect
and so is the great majority
someone is [cuellicorto] someone has a on [estilizada] without the [curvas] right and someone suffering obesity
the [estilista] has of know arise [ópticamente] a shoulders [anchos] [alargar] a bottleneck or [recrear] the [curvas] necessary
we have given certain noticed on how to i the body of women the kind of [jennifer] valverde of [pechos] and [caderas] enormous but [cintura] close and the same time not [vestirla] of a way too [desafiante]
if for example the difference between the [cintura] and the [caderas] is so that the skirt or the trousers not is [adaptan] is the it done [coser] the least a paper of manipulated [extra] to measure
without doubt not is [arrepentirán] because the clothes that where perfectly is [impagable]
with a skirt to measure is relieved a better that with a that not for of get [levantarse] [baila] in the [cintura] etc
the body [estilizado] is can allow wear clothes with [pliegues] [adornos] [bordados] or [drapeados]
there certainly many types of information various and of bodies so that i readjust of that have of whole the week for to order in my head whole this information
and even so i fear that with the task [asignada] already i more that of too
to every participant in the course is you have allocated two famous to the that must solutions two [vestuarios] one for the day and another for the night
there that have in account the aspect current the lifestyle of fashionable that is [adecue] to the person in question
i has [tocado] apos wear apos to [miranda] kerr perhaps the [conozcáis] of the campaign of victory apos s [secret]
out for within for me is a better that for example [britney] [spears] or [christina] [aguilera] that recently will [engordado] a hundred kilo for favour have in account the excessive or the [jovencísima] [selena] [gómez]
the overalls we that [recortarlos] of the weeklies or [buscarlos] in internet and [imprimirlos] for after [elaborarlos] wholeheartedly
the [moodboard] that is as is way the result completely this also our lifestyle personal and our relationship with the design [gráfico]
is important also think in the part [gráfica] the [estilismo]
the [estilista] for therefore not [viste] only physically but that also is taken for example of the pages of products in the weeklies of subjects specific as trends [bolsos] coats etc
of all this we spoke the [estilista] and leather mauro [kameník]
but all this already is for the sunday
the [estilista] has of have a vision global
the three invited specialists him the conference the saturday with information on all kind of bodies
the [estilista] [honza] [pokorný] the leather of fashionable [jakub] [polanka] and the [fotógrafo] of fashionable ben [renč]
[jakub] we reminded that the fashionable is a illusion and the [estilista] should [saberle] from party to this
and a good [estilista] know work with a same [prenda] of wear of forms various
the [variabilidad] is in this case fundamental
so the such [gabardina] or as say in english [trench] [coat] is can wear to what stale with [vaqueros] and [camiseta] but also serves for wear the body naked with shoes of [tacón] and [fotografiarlo] as if it in reality a clothing
or well enough [arremangarla] and higher the bottleneck for obtain a image completely different
apos [jugad] with this apos we stressed
what that more [valoro] is the next council apos for start to work ago lack that first [conozcáis] all the rules apos
apos then already quot [romperlas] apos said [jakub]
for end i is clear for what [memorizamos] all these keep what is being with what for what if then is that in the weeklies of fashionable we we results different
that without about of the [desfiles]
thank the [fotógrafo] ben i that a [estilista] has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the that to [fotografiar]
so for a history of fashionable that have ten pages for therefore ten [outfits] there that have splendid lists for use the least fifteen
and also that the photos the clothes works in combination with other [prendas] all them different to the that is mines in the reality
all this there that times in account to the time of solutions the [outfit]
[honza] [pokorný] we assured that the image and the lifestyle excessive them alone in many cases the half the success
enough look to [madonna] that not is precisely a as extraordinary but the image and the [márquetin] have fact of she a star world
in liberec for the time not there still a trend clear to use the services of the [estilistas]
to the resolute famous also what are pointless i mere my skills my aspect physical not has so importance
and when someone we [pida] our services there that have in account that is very likely that we [indiquen] a stature very different to the their real will
then only is [guglear] and physically if the weeklies the heart already have writing on the issue if a certain [celebridad] has [engordado] [adelgazado] etc
the sunday [honza] and mauro we [insistieron] in that the [estilista] not you enough [orientarse] in the fashionable but that has that understand of [outfit]
for their work on all is must communicate with the people to the that [viste] for what that is fundamental be a good psychologist
know appreciate to the people not is ago of least stand their views
apos when a director you [contrata] for that you [clasifiquéis] the [vestuario] and is what [completéis] with [prendas] fine not quot take and throwing all what that had and say apos [huy] what horror apos apos
apos [encontrad] the least a couple of things that [podáis] [ponderar] and recommend for that someone is the can to apos says mauro
he same also we was that all must [caber] in the called apos [placovka] apos is say the exchange of work
this is set around of the [cintura] and is have there all the tools necessary
are items as nail as nail [quitapelusas] or [imperdibles] there also balance of [nailon] that you serves the [estilista] for the session of photos of products such that [bolsos] or [gorros] [pinzas] special of [enganche] of [prendas] for front if this outside greater the [alfileres] and another kind of [enganches] not are [permitidos] therefore could damage the fabric or a game of remnant
for not slogans in the usual [pasiva] and to something in practice we learned to [revestir] the [suela] of the shoes
even for the session of photos in the study in a surface flat is could damage the [suela] and a more still the foreign
and not we more that [revestir] and [revestir]
not could play the shoes with the nail for not [dañarlos] for accident
so that had that be very [hábil]
mauro i has given a joy the who my work without reserves
the truth is that not is i are very well these skills
this is only a small part of all the that we heard for all the end of week in the second part the course
already i i given account that commit the [estilismo] to level professional not is a way of tinted but i of exactly as what that telling the people
in [need] for [speed] the [run] is disappear for whole america
dealt
a journey in principle [despreocupado] is complicates to cause of a series of [descuidos] [impropios] of a journey routine for the time of morning
in certain measure is managed cover the expectations but this not serves of nothing if in reality not is intended to nothing so
the new over to the that the title is adds the [run] kindled large expectations already before of their [estreno]
[prometía] that would new buenos to the former [saga] of to [need] for [speed] and to as of what shown is as a game that not should end being other time a gender of action without more
also we we [curiosos] for know how einstein the scenes [insertadas] where the apos main falling the car and watch for their own ordinary
as often happen in the [series] of [nfs] the results not an great thing regard to what that we those
there to that is can give for volumes but in the [cómputo] total is some points to cause of failures absurd that already come [apareciendo] in the series since ago years
in reality not is can not calling errors but that is is more well of the [desgana] incomprehensible of the [programadores]
the adventure starts very well
is you predictability in a history whose leading as has certain problems personal for [resolverlos] is you offers participate in a career illegal for whole america
you [sentáis] the [volante] in the at west in st which and tardiness mission is to the first to new york
the idea is offer something interesting
the route is into in ten stages and then in more of fifty to
of this is follows that every career has place for a route different and the stages are [localizadas] in different environments that are quite various and interesting
of that way one not has not [remotamente] the that of that the game will always what same
some of the environments are even [agradables] to the view although the level technical the [gráfico] is equivalent the of evidence previous of the series
for therefore not is nothing the another world
but the walk for the desert the landscape [otoñal] or the high mountains covered of snow is a effect about very an
also the to is [diversifican] of time in when for a element [atípico]
so for example in the desert you [encontráis] a storm of bit that ever the visibility
in change in the mountains there that have care for that not you [sepulte] a [avalancha]
according that every a of the to is very well developed
only there a couple of models but with that enough
for a time [intentáis] [adelantar] to a amount of rival [exigida] what normal in a career classical after [tratáis] of win time duel stale [cronometrado] and then you expected a duel against a only [adversario]
in half of all this is to sometimes the police that not ago but obstruct still more the things
the element are the landscape outside the car
is have [animaciones] [interactivas] when as in the majority of the cases has of escape of someone and you you that [ayudarlo] always [pulsando] the [botón] fair in the time fair
nothing complicated
is surprising without however that has enough least landscape in the game of what that be wait in particular there only three
but the result end is positive because this element not comes to be upsetting and in the context already mentioned is one of the elements that do that the game it more interesting
the model of underlined still the fingerprinting of the episodes previous
that to say that to day of today already not be great thing but not is can that that be bad
if [buscáis] a [simulación] realistic already quot to in other part
but to a career replaced with quite action you be quite this lifestyle of underlined although we find something better between the games of the competition
to here all in order
but the problems arise after of a true time
to difference of what right of the models of underlined already not happens what same with the collisions
of games of this kind not is wait that [recree] [deformaciones] and collisions complicated but of fact before of a coup against any subject not quot predict how [reaccionará] [vuestro] cars with what which not all is in order
is typical that the to a [adelantamiento] very [ajustado] or able the cars with a traffic normal so only has covered [roces] but in other situations almost identical [vuestro] cars has doing [piruetas] [descontroladas]
or even has completely destroyed
thank the system of [reseteo] not arise large problems but can [poneros] of is humour
the [reseteos] are [programados] of such way that when [sufres] a accident or you [sales] of the back the game you [restituye] the last point of rescue in the back
without however in every career only is at of five [reseteos] available
if the [consumís] all you that restart the career since the principle
so therefore not is more that a aid in case of that something not will well but not is very of [fiar]
to sometimes not the [reseteo] aid only aid the [aprenderse] the stage on of memory
a great disadvantage the game is that the ourselves facts is are in different places
in some [curvas] for example there that into of a way specific of another way are being of take
other sometimes you [encontráis] in some website vehicles apos civil apos always with the same configuration although [estéis] the first [quintos] or [lleguéis] five minutes before or after
this ago of [rabiar] on all in situations when [veis] that two [autos] that will the i in directions suppress your [contrincante] [adelanta] without problems but when [llegáis] [debéis] [girar] or well ruthless
is as when [lleguéis] because is programmed for that the apos surprise apos always will front of release [narices]
the adversaries have also a advantage more
for whole the starting [llegaréis] to websites where without have in account the time always you [adelantará] the same [adversario] in the same website
also this happens the end of the starting in a long bridge what which is still more [chocante]
[vuestro] [oponente] must to before that you the price that be
when is front of you you difficult the vision of the [autos] that come of with so that the principle quot to [papilla] the car
is can understand the idea of create a game with maximum takes of [suspense] and [adrenalina] but the execution is so apparent that surely you [decepcione] delay
and is a it because although the model the journey be simple the game is fun and with action of way that to often not is possible to the detail what that is not where
and really of as if the merit is has the idea with fifty runs standardise or the classification in the career for that not [quepa] the platitude or any other thing
a idea [inhabitual] is the change of [autos] for the to
you that be to to the [surtidores] of petrol the on of the road because exactly there you that change of cars although in the great majority of the cases you suffice what that you
the [autos] is into in three categories
the sport are suitable for areas urban the [autos] strong american for the motorways [rectas] and the [exóticos] [superdeportivos] for a underlined technical for example for roads of mountain with [curvas]
also balance [narrativo] main also is a balance of challenges parallel is say there to in places specific that [conoceréis] for the stories
here [conseguiréis] not only rich but also points of experience for [vuestro] profile that serves therefore for the challenges as the [cuentos]
the achieve the level higher the driver is you open several for beginning for the cars and [acabando] with funds for the profile
the same time there [conectada] a role [autolog] in line that preceding [vuestros] results with the of other players and [disponibiliza] other duties community
one of the elements more difficult of understand is how is made the last career in the history
with the car [llegáis] to the tunnel the metre pass where you [ponéis] to to to shameful for the to pass
the [velocímetro] you mark between 150 and 200 km h pass and of suddenly for behind you comes the [convoy] the metre and is you has for front without more
in the significant surely we a discussion on this for several days on if for the programming the game none was even a little or if the authors of truth we take for a bunch of [bobos]
the part technical the game not is nothing so but the least the effects [visuales] general are in the majority of the cases [agradables] to sometimes to [soberbios]
therefore what it that in the at more [tensos] is reduces the quality of image and in times of a way serious
this affects on all to the accidents where there [involucrados] many participants when the quality of image continual already not is valid
the audio is well and the bandwidth [sonora] is a question of tastes
to end of that be the welcome to the greater part the group youth the bandwidth [sonora] belongs to the category apos every one of their father and of their mother apos but is can mean that no torment the game only for their music
the that end of [need] for [speed] the [run] is therefore quite confused
if the game [evitase] errors absolutely thinks we we problems in that that the [run] is the better game of [nfs] of the last years
of the that of that the game not is completed
the [diversión] is [asegurada] but [preparaos] because the errors you slap in the eyes with the force of a [reflectores] of airport

how have out the prices of the travel since 1989
to 1989 had in the czechoslovakia of then only five agencies of travel state you [Čedok] [sporturist] [ckm] [rekrea] and [autoturist]
the agencies of travel of at time [vendían] in the majority of the cases travel only the bloc socialist therefore the travel to west were very [restringidos]
the tourists czech would for therefore of holiday to the beaches of the sprinkler republic democratic german to the union soviet [sochi] in [crimea] in the sea black to bulgaria and romania both in the sea black and to hungary [balaton]
a exception positive was the period for between 1962 and 1972 when is could travel to yugoslavia without however after the regime [yugoslavo] is [inclinó] towards the west and the travel of the tourists czech were then quite [restringidos]
a great somewhat the socialism was the fact that to the citizens the bloc socialist or be also to the [checoeslovacos] not is them [permitiese] travel free and processing not even for the countries socialists
if a citizen wanted travel processing for example to poland or to the union soviet needed a letter of invitation if not the journey individual not was possible
the agencies of journey [ofrecían] in those times also travel the west but one is should to to the eu with a together of ball and to so whole the night or have apos good known apos in the agency
still so not all was cattle
the called apos promise of change apos that was the condition for the travel the west not is [concedía] to the apos people politically little reliable apos that so not could travel in at
the currency [checoslovaca] not was a currency freely converted and without guarantee of change not was possible obtain the resources the currency western for travel to west
the great majority of the czech experience their holiday in their own country for what that had a great number of infestation and houses of summer that the czech [adquirían] this preparation still there
the way of travel of the czech has suffered since 1989 a real revolution
while that to 1989 for us was the not is more to the holiday in the sprinkler or bulgaria the year last the czech did 4 5 million of travel of holiday to countries of all the world
is [nna] great somewhat of the that today day already not we aware the fact of that the destination currently odds croatia to 1989 not is could travel freely because was part of the yugoslavia of then
to principles of the years 90 is imposed the exemption of visa for travel to the states neighbours of europe western what that resulted a wave huge of visits of short term [sobretodo] to vienna or germany
the [checoeslovacos] for a time not is his [hartos] of the [excursiones] the west all the world wanted it the what least for a time
for example in paris [dormían] the groups of czech in the parks in shops of campaign already that our income of then not we [permitían] pay a hotel or pension
a feature typical of the czech of at time was the be for the food tomatoes pieces etc for save
another time important was the introduction of the [convertibilidad] of the nickel czech so our tourists could finally after of decades buy freely currency western
our level of life [aumentaba] and with he also the wages media what that around of 1997 resulted a increase in the demand of travel
with the increase of the demand of travel they the agencies to from of 1997 with regularly to preparation the travel using the colleges of flights [chárter] what that was down incredibly the prices of the travel in compared with the last thank to the possibility of obtain ups for the volume of passengers
to end of the 90 the century last already the czech found without visa to almost all the countries developed are us us what which [simplificó] still more our travel
another time interesting in the history the tourism stepping [revolucionario] happened already in the 2000 when was organised thank to a huge demand the first flight direct since liberec to a country [exótico] and was to thailand
since at year proceed all the years flights [chárter] direct with tourists czech was countries distant and [calurosos] this winter already is [volará] directly since liberec to 12 destinations [exóticos]
the countries [exóticos] the their currently close of 100 billion czech the year
another time interesting of this time that symbolises our development stepping [revolucionario] came in the year 2008
the 17 of november of 2008 us us squeezed the visa for the tourists czech with what that our country happened to be between the countries more developed the world
in 2008 the czech for first time in their history have last more of the half of their holiday in the abroad 50 3 and for first time in their history is have spent in travel the abroad more of 15 billion billion czech for head including the expenditure in the website of stay
tandare house general ordinary for choose the president that could end of new in point died
since ago almost five months the football czech is without president and is likely that the successor of safronov [hašek] as president of the federation czech of [futbol] [faČr] not is [conocerá] not after the call of the next house general extraordinary that will place this thursday in [nymburk]
of fact still not is has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to to
without the same not is will vote even for choose between the three candidates
the interested to [presidir] the football czech are [jindřich] [rajchl] [miroslav] [pelta] and [tomáš] [paclík]
[hašek] [renunció] to their office in june not without before rectify to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that [supiese] deals the football in the future
without however after of conclude the was [hašek] is used a controversy between the two [federaciones] of the partnership unable of to to a agreement for decisions a candidate common
this became in obvious the 16 of september when had that be elected the new president
the delegates of the house general is met in vain in the home national [národní] [dům] on in the area [praguense] of [smíchov] because the discussions is had blocked and not only in as the method of election
not is came to no consensus not in as to who in the house general had right to vote only the representatives legal or also the delegates with a powers
to from of that time and because to this only point is in a agreement part supported also for the recommendation the institute of state and right according the which the representation for a powers not is possible
without however the disputes on the code electoral are open
more light on the situation already not could should not the committee executive that in their meetings [ordinarias] or extraordinary all not vihear nothing
the opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of sometimes already but the point nerve still being the same
the question is the next do of what way to in the third round for avoid the point died
apos the dispute this in about to if is must to of agreement with the [estatutos] or find another model apos says [dušan] [svoboda] one of the three [vicepresidentes] of the [faČr] that since the direction of the partnership represents the [futbol] professional
according the model proposed in the [estatutos] in the third round going at candidate that have greater percentage of support in the federation to the which will their candidacy
the region of moravia is ready to to to a compromise for that can win at candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both [federaciones]
the part bohemia without however which the condition of that the winner according these are [porcentuales] should have the majority of the least two thirds
apos this you [quitaría] without however the sense to the two rounds previous and [negaría] for completely the concept of system [bicameral] apos so is as [svoboda] understand the concerns of the part [morava] according what which what better would not play the order and vote according the [estatutos] files
with what said surprisingly is of agreement also [tomaš] [paclík] although is is that the regulation electoral established for the [estatutos] of all the candidates be more to [pelta]
apos i like that is [votara] the maximum of agreement with the [estatutos] apos
apos for that not is [inventen] no [tontería] about of the representatives as in the last house general apos says the you of victory [plzen] that is [postula] for first time as candidate and that at their comments mainly in against of [pelta]
[pelta] still being positive
according he in [nymburk] is decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future [cooperaran] of way constructive
apos all the [pasiones] is [apaciguarán] with the party of today of our team national in the championship european
apos the football will to be leading and so is [cooperara] more to will apos says the representative the [jablonice] that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football therefore to level professional as regional
[rajchl] is the more reluctant
apos i that is it to a agreement but for unfortunately the situation is a more difficult apos
apos not is is the conflict between [bohemios] and [moravos] but there attempts of [ajustar] the rules to their own convenience apos
apos this can have as result a new deadlock of the house general apos
apos of all case i that is pizarro the sense common apos said [rajchl]
already not is a time for that all the parties are to a agreement
some negotiations had that take in montenegro but do who can know to that start the party if the team of football will completely
the air special in the that had that travel to [podgorica] between other the [vicepresidentes] [dalibor] [kucera] and [rajchl] not has out this morning for problems technical in prague taking that other a alternative for carry to part the committee executive the place where will place the party of classification
[quizas] the meeting decisive for end could be the that will place to level ministerial that according have is will this wednesday
to [josef] [dobeš] minister of education youth and sports you like a integrate to the parties divided to the organisation integrating more powerful the country for that is it to a agreement
there a in game the benefits state the credibility the football and also the next house general the committee central of the federation [checoslovaca] the sport [Čstv] that awareness made of a new direction the sport czech after the problems financial of the home of [loterías] [sazka]
[paclík] [luchará] for achieve the presidency because not is a candidate more appropriate
if the head of the [futbolistas] of [pilsen] [tomaš] [paclik] before of the house general extraordinary [conociera] the name of a candidate appropriate that [satisficiese] all their ideas on the new president of the federation czech of football [faČr] not is would as candidate to a since so relevant
apos if would a person appropriate would fighting for she and not i would as candidate to the elections apos
apos but to the day of today not is has been find a person so apos said [paclík] for the agency of news czech [Čtk]
what that justifies to [paclík] to into in the challenge with [miroslav] [pelta] and [henry] [rajchl] is exactly the possibility of block to [pelta] the course winner of the elections that opens the way to the presidency of the federation czech of [futbol] [faČr]
[paclík] also [puntualiza] that in case through [permanecería] in the office of president only to 2013 when overdue the time of the house general ordinary
in that office you like see to a expert and good managing that not is too related with the events fans
apos already i about with some people to the that could have in account apos
apos for me was a madness hear to some say that in this time not even want identify with the football czech apos
apos i like change that vision apos adds
what that supposed more bother to [paclík] in this time is the relationship of [pelta] with the president of the partnership of football regional of [pilsen] polanski [berbr] a man with a last controversial known outside the [mundillo] as a [poderoso] [lobista] with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in the house general
for [paclík] is so unacceptable see to [pelta] at in the [sillón] presidential
apos in case of that [gane] is nazarbayev the status existing and nothing in the football will apos
apos with the support of [berbra] a man of business ambitious the football sorry still least from apos said [paclík]
mentions also the fact of that ago a years the name of [pelta] was related with a usual telephone for the research of a case of corruption of the which [pelta] went [impune]
apos not i what prestige the football could bring the victory of [pelta] apos
apos and with what eyes we plead the uefa and the fifa apos said [paclík] that also decision with certain caution their declaration previous that apos [vendería] the club [pilsen] if [pelta] is become in president apos
in the case of win the elections the thursday [paclík] could be the cooperation with [pelta] in the future
of same opinion is the another candidate [rajchl] that has been supported for [paclík] before of the house general of september that end in a [fiasco]
apos he [pelta] would the first the that solitary apos
apos is very capable apos
apos i what could imagine for example as head of the representation apos
apos but not as managing of a partnership apos
apos i not [meto] the [narices] there where not i i capable apos added [paclík] that in september [suscitó] very attention for support the from of the commission of [Árbitros] [presidida] for [ludek] [macel] potential after for [dagmar] [damkova]
[paclík] accepts that is [atrevería] to manage the partnership
particularly to their capacities of management of the companies private therefore since the summer last is also the director the [pilsen] that with their support took in may the [triunfo] in first division
apos i force for change some things in the area of football and make to their practice safe apos
apos for reduce the influence of some groups of pressure that probably tend to influence in the decisions the committee refunded and of appeal have situations unpleasant said [paclík] without so their [antipatías] towards the president the [sparta] daniel [křetínský]
a of the priorities also would the of consolidate the relationship between the [faČr] and the committee [olímpico] czech with the aid the which [ejercía] pressure on the leaders political for that socrates more money the sport of the tax of the i
apos is one of the problems key the that is should conducting the new president apos
apos if [aumentaran] the tax on the games of gambling as what [anuncian] the parties political support their arguments but frankly have that us where is to stop all this money apos out
[ademas] [paclík] now not has in account even their partnership with the club [pilsner] although he same says that the president of the [faČr] must be apos not she apos
[pelta] is to their time related with [jablonec] and [rajchl] with [dukla] of prague
apos not is ideal apos
apos but not i sense the fact of yield preach my actions the club of [pilsen] to other person for then again there after a year and half apos said [paclík]
[pelta] promised to the [faČr] new [estatutos] that [acabarían] with the point died of the elections
two days before of the house general of the partnership of football one of the candidates to the presidency [miroslav] [pelt] promised that in case of be elected coordinating that the [faČr] had a new [estatutos] that [sirvieran] definitely for right in the future the controversy in as the regulation electoral
the representative the [jablonec] is positive in as to the meeting of this thursday in [nymburk] and believes that the conflict [preelectoral] could move towards a solution today with the possible victory the team of football
already before of the elections not made in september [pelta] promised firstly in case of be elected precisely in the representation and in custom funds
decided participate in the last minute in the last house general for what that this be of two months you could go well for defend and present in a context more broader their ideas on the management the football
apos the people of all the levels is taken the football already ago a time and expected know this thursday the new president apos
apos feel that has come the time of that someone [gestione] the partnership apos think the man that is couples mainly with the club of [jablonice] but that worked in the [sparta] and in the committee executive of the partnership
for this reason believes have enough experience for manage the football czech
is convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that hung in the time of safronov [hašek]
apos unfortunately in the house general of june were adopted the [estatutos] that not were so planned as all ideologically apos
apos if [excluimos] certain interpretations we a president already since september apos warned [pelta]
exactly the [readaptación] the document more important of the partnership aids is [usó] as [señuelo] for who to the delegates
apos if i [eligen] president i what counts as a challenge personal and i prepared to respond in case of that this [falle] apos
apos is a question of principles without the which not we there apos says [pelta]
also in theory is not over with their opponents
already in the last had your that is was mercy with [henry] [rajchl] the that respects for their training in right being aware of that their [oponente] would also their first vice
already was a time without attack to he [paclík] who the contrary of [pelta] not he pawn with head
apos has more of a year in the world of football and already has achieved some successes apos
apos their attacks but were [vergonzosos] and very people became amazed for the campaign electoral apos
apos for that many of them [dudan] on their real nature apos said to their flee [pelta] that still being faithful to the statements announced already in september
their weapon more powerful is according he their knowledge the football since the apos more low to the with
this last should be [escaparate] of promotion the football
apos also [intentaría] right all the [escándalos] that ems to cause of the [bohemians] as result the scandal of corruption the year last apos
apos immediately after i [involucraría] in the negotiations with the sector public and the private for ensure that has enough money for all the football apos said ago two months to the [Čtk] the candidate of 46 years
to continuation also promised that their appointment as president the football not [comportaría] no change personal of the [plantilla]
apos would that know first the tasks of every he apos said she to [strahov] where after a long period of [anarquía] has a [nerviosismo] comprehensible
to despite of the scenarios doomsday current that is [vaticinan] to the next house general he believes that the delegates not travel in vain this thursday to [nymburk]
apos if the only point of disagreement will how vote in the third round without doubt what we overcome
apos the football needs credibility the which is will only if for end has a leader apos still two days before of the apos more decisive in their career of representative [pelta] still being positive
[rajchl] enforce that under their leadership the [faČr] [empezaría] to work with wish
if in the quarter house general its elected the current vice [jindrich] [rajchl] as new president of the partnership of football czech very people is remuneration surely [resentida]
[rajchl] enforce that in case of be elected is [trabajaría] hard
to implement a change systematic and to that the member the committee executive are responsible of every area the football processing
also is compromises to resolve the case of the [bohemians] improve the relations with the uefa and the fifa to more money for the football and continue with the work on for the previous president safronov [hašek]
apos as president i like commit for completely the football apos
apos since the contacts international with the uefa and the fifa to the selection happening for the football professional or the invariably of young [futbolistas] of high performance apos
apos with this not i say that what would all only apos said [rajchl] in a interview for the [Čtk]
apos i a player of team and i gentleman the powers the committee executive of such way that every member can their to a area taxation apos
apos and [asignaré] tasks difficult for that the football can in every one of these [segmentos] to forward with a momentum apos
apos to very people this probably not you [gustará] because busies start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the others apos added
because to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement [futbolístico] is says that has have the possibility of not stand of new as candidate
apos all know that work 20 hours joys apos
apos but need know that this will sense and that not will people behind of my that i – and [obstaculizará] to every step apos he so the for of their [indecisión]
apos very people i has said that not i asked for zero because then is fico for [vencidos] also the others apos
apos is is of have faith for not leave so without more apos said
according say you justifies also continue the work that already began with [hašek]
apos for these two years is end a great part the work that not i that now is vanish apos
apos there processes that is had started and that will their effect within of a couple of years and not i like that someone the [pare] apos announced concerned for the fact of that if [eligieran] the another candidate [miroslav] [pelta] the situation in the partnership could again to be such as was before of the time of [hašek]
apos i i in the order and is something that in my opinion [mirek] [pelta] not is capable of keep
apos behind of he is on all whole that people that is [ocuparía] the football for that outside only a privileged for a few elected apos
apos is i can [reprochar] a lot of things but not the fact of that i to favour of someone apos
apos attempt be aim apos
apos i to a football for all because only so is [sentirán] well all and not only the elected apos said [rajchl]
this also the idea that only serious karlsbad the president
apos although some people seeking that what contrary i in mind to what maximum for moravia apos
apos for example is time of think in the fact of gentleman the second division in a part czech and in other [morava] whose winners [irían] to the first division apos
apos not is would the situation current in the that we only three equipment of moravia what that represents a problem for the players [moravos] young apos said [rajchl]
although to the [pugna] of the elections presidential is [sumó] [tomaš] [paclík] president the club [pilsner] [rajchl] not is of believe in their for of be elected
apos still i have a strong support of the federation czech the which i was as their vice and that know that behind of me there successes clear apos said [rajchl] whose successes understand the saving of a tens of million of billion of contracts [desventajosos] the negotiations of contracts [televisivos] and the negotiations on the law of the i
for another on recognised their part of fault in that the federation not is united
and while civilized that [pelta] is apos [descalificado] for to the confidence in the football czech apos as the another rival [paclík] as a candidate strong that yes has something that offer the football
apos no can for that was a great work for the [pilsen] at year apos

now the at a german
sure that [axel] weber not what had considered
after of their witnessed starting of the summit the bank federal in july is through that in 2013 [comenzaría] in a new and almost also of witnessed work president the council administrative the great bank swiss [ubs] a [inesperado] and lucrative step in their career
[axel] weber is am should commends switzerland for their beauty and to the [ubs] for their new acquired strength and is fall comments [amables] on their future colleagues
apos the drives has achieved a revival apos
apos i am cooperate with [kaspar] [villiger] and [oswald] [grübel] apos
in september became clear that all would completely different
a for financial of the drives in london prevented all the systems of security the bank and [defraudó] 1 7 billion million of eur
[oswald] [grübel] director general of the drives a banker not only known in switzerland had that come
the president the council administrative of the drives is was since then also [tocado] and all good do when comes [axel] weber
is through that weber must advise the bank since february of 2012
and is will office of the presidency the council administrative in may not to principles of 2013 as the bank [comunicó] the tuesday
this is hard for [axel] weber
not is banker more well professor of economy and [consejero] and has had a period of adjustment surely necessary
of coup is ago responsible of the strategy of a bank that has of again to prove that deserves the title apos the greater bank the scandal of europe apos since ago time
for a part the drives is huge to ago little was the greater administrator of goods world and for other part since ago years is [desliza] of a scandal the next
nothing so what seems is you [ahorra] the changed so proud bank swiss
started the crisis financial
the drives had a reputation excellent to 2007
the image the administrator of goods swiss [discreto] and hardest but also [mañoso] is [combinó] with objectives ambitious also wanted be a great number in the banks of investment
for a part with 1 6 billion of dollars the drives variety more money of customers wealthiest that any another bank the world
and for other part [avanzó] as bank of investment in the league of the large banks the world
this [impresiona]
hans [geiger] the former banker and of professor of [banca] in [zurich] for many years explains apos to my students always i described to the drives as model of a good bank apos
apos since the point of view current one is question do how could [equivocarme] apos
was in a great mistake
in the year 2007 went to the light that something went very is in the drives
to mid of year peter [wuffli] director general that to then was have as a banker [genial] and very intelligent resigned surprisingly
some months after is [sospechó] the reason
the fund of investment the bank is [embarcó] in losses with titles of high risk and had that [amortizar] thousands of million
for should with this the drives announced a [inyección] of capital of nothing least that of 13 billion million of frf
for this found investors course that some [miraran] with contemptuous to little before a fund state asia and [opaco] of singapore and a fund state arab so [discreto] that never is had heard their name
this was only the first coup
in april of 2008 [empeoró]
the bank had that on the loss of thousands of million [marcel] [ospel] president the council administrative in 2006 in the second better paid council administrative of switzerland resigned
in october of 2008 she the disaster in view of their investment wrong the [ubs] is found in the crisis financial to the costing and had that be [rescatada] for the state
the bank national [compró] values problem to the [ubs] for many thousands of million the confederation [helvética] was six thousands of million of frf for a [bono] sensible converted by the that is [convertía] in [copropietaria] the bank
whole switzerland was affected is said what dramatic that was this for a country small if [aloja] to banks so large
finally the sum the balance of the [ubs] in 2007 was more of five sometimes greater that the results economic of switzerland see [gráfica]
apos not we again to rescue to the [ubs] apos said [geiger] expert in [banca]
to the first disaster is joined the second
few months after the [ubs] [capituló] in a conflict tax with america and is was ready to limits the data of the customers wealthiest that possibly had [defraudado] tax with aid the bank
also whereby a figure of 780 thousands of million of dollars point of profits [injustificados] of these business with a compensation for payment
with this the [ubs] [confesó] more or least have helped in the fraud tax
vet lost something that had been since always their capital in the competition for customers rich the [aureola] of discretion
after the scandal the secret the bank swiss already not is the same
to this continued the resignation the president of the junta directive and the president the council administrative
and the emigration of the funds of the customers
of this way in few months the bank lost their credibility in their two sectors central in the [banca] of investment by the speculation flawed and in the administration of goods by the aid the fraud tax
and fair when readjust to be something more relaxed fair when is i that the [ubs] readjust to this is this [desdichada] history the for a for individual [defraudó] 1 7 billion million of eur before of that the bank is [diera] account of that something was is
and is [desveló] for what seen this still not works well with the management of risk in the [banca] of investment
apos with the case [adoboli] is world that the controls of risk have changed too little apos says martin [janssen] professor of economy and finance in the institute banking of the university of [zurich]
the director financial of a great bank german also is sure apos the problem of the [ubs] is that not dominates the controls of risk apos
for what that about the idea of the caution with the that the bankers swiss is were since ago time be the watch of the elderly goods the world no risk too large in change the security the money to [quebrar] the another on of the republic believing
the brains of security of the banks swiss were the symbol of the reliability [inquebrantable] as [lindt] and [sprüngli] the chocolate genuine
the central of the [ubs] in [zurich] not dovetails with the buzz the hardest bank private swiss only is a little greater
the situation is classical
the bank has their based main in the street [bahnhofstraße] of [zurich] that is since the station main directly the shores of [zurich] [enmarcado] for the summits covered of snow of the mountains [suizas]
here the buildings are [ostentosos] the sells are a of the more higher of europe
here is are [joyerías] as [tiffany] s between business traditional swiss as the [confitería] [sprüngli]
here they since ago years the banks swiss since the bank national happening for the palacio of [credit] [suisse] to the [elitarios] banks private as [julius] [bär]
is will in the room of reception of the [ubs] by a disproportionately door chair
within the walls are [revestidas] of [mármol] front is are large [sillones] of such together the logo the bank there a great [letrero] for indicate the apos security apos
the [ubs] know what that the client search here security
the two large banks swiss the [ubs] and [credit] [suisse] in some time have [desplazado] the idea the great bank swiss or the have betrayed as view the president of a small bank private swiss
prefer not read their name in the newspaper the end and the out ago as all the bankers swiss also with the business of both large banks
the [ubs] is has fact too large view mainly in the [banca] of investment where the saxon have cattle ground
there the swiss not had nothing more that say
apos and is have have for a time to the our of the saxon apos
of fact the [ubs] changed the [banca] of investment with handed their first great proposed and then wine the disaster no entity financial european had lost therefore money in the [jungla] the high risk as the great bank swiss
the 15 of october of 2008 the disaster was clear
apos that wednesday the coalition government the small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of their nation apos says the author [lukas] [hässig] in their book apos de [ubs] [crash] apos apos the [crash] of the [ubs] apos in spanish
the political granted to 68 thousands of million of frf or approximately 45 thousands of million of eur for save the great bank of the [bancarrota]
do how is them happens
is about with the bankers swiss so are the problem in the dimension of the [ubs]
in june of 1998 two of the three large banks swiss is [fusionan] in a [poderoso] consortium
from a bank that because to the merger was too large for the small switzerland and still growing
for what that was for that the two different banks precursors of the [ubs] is [complementaran] a bank rico but royce with the centre of the administration of goods in [zurich] and a [internacionalización] more poor but more strong
of suddenly the banks of investment [internacionalizados] came of way have with a money with the that could to [rodar] a great bicycle financial
there two names related with this takes of the [ubs] peter [wuffli] head the consortium of the [ubs] of 2001 to 2007 and [marcel] [ospel] then president the council administrative
apos always i that [wuffli] and [ospel] were a team perfect apos says the expert in [banca] hans [geiger]
apos [wuffli] the intellectual modest that understand a of models and statistics and [ospel] the [intuitivo] that managed showed step since the learning in the bank to the summit apos
finally [ospel] is [fió] of [wuffli]
and the end [wuffli] was probably a mistake decisive apos was that their models were a reality apos says [geiger]
apos is a case tragic apos
tragic perhaps
is clear the [desatino] came before the case
the employees of the [ubs] is remember clearly of the meetings of superiors in the that [wuffli] the head the consortium always [repetía] the same motto down the seat to sink sachs
the bank american was the bank of investment more [poderoso] the world
[encabezaban] the apos [league] [tables] apos the [clasificaciones] that then [documentaban] the success of the banks
the [ubs] wanted be in the summit
some steps you forthcoming well
in the operations of [divisas] and in the negotiating of actions was in what more high
without however the advisers of companies makers put of highlighted a point weak in the business the interest international in the language of [banca] apos [fixed] [income] apos there a compensation huge for the large banks
the [ubs] has [vacíos] in the products [hipotecarios] american
for fill these [vacíos] the [ubs] started a adventure that almost you costs their existence
[Ávidos] of growth [invirtieron] therefore the same bank as one of their funds of high risk created in investment american of high risk
is transformed in a machine powerful for [titularizar] appropriations [hipotecarios] american and [venderlos] to continuation [manteniendo] certain risks to account own
and also as other banks at the [bajada] for a time
apos in summer of 2007 as the market estate american was in [llamas] the [ubs] [compró] there apos said [geiger] expert in [banca]
so large the euphoria so thorough the fall
a managing had that go already that the attempt of one was more complicated of what that were
the jobs in the [ubs] is became in seats [proyectables] and are [inseguros] to the today
currently who at a great bank has a work almost impossible
must find a strategy for a bank to the that all the models of business [lógicos] are stumbling
[geiger] expert in banks has a idea to end to the [banca] of investment focus in the administration of goods return to the roots [suizas]
the bank not to to so far still
but the [banca] of investment must decrease a is clear currently
the next thursday [sergio] [ermotti] the new president the bank will their future strategy the world
in reality only is was in the italian swiss of 51 years as a solution specify already that the bank the bank is [separó] surprisingly of their predecessor [grübel]
meanwhile he is imposed must you of way permanent the business of the [ubs] [comunicó] the bank of [zurich] the tuesday
[ermotti] to restore the bank of investment to their state to mid of the nineties
makes 3 500 jobs
but this not enough
the [ubs] needs a vision
do who is
do with what to win money
these are the questions that sure is ago [axel] weber currently
to the time only says that first [buscará] a housing with their woman in [zurich]

mission despite the congress prepared for to to a agreement on libya
seems that finally republican and democrats in the nerve are prepared to only of agreement on something related with the embargo in libya
all what that is needed was that the which had success that the contractor dictator [muamar] the gaddafi outside apprehended and murdered and the participation of states united came to their end
the tuesday the committee of affairs foreign the senate is to be a resolution [patrocinada] for the president john [kerry] democrat for [massachusetts] together with the [senadores] john [mccain] [republicano] for coldest and wresinski i [lieberman] independent for [connecticut] [aplaudiendo] to the who for their successful which and to the troops of us us for their apos courage apos
apos this resolution is for [honrar] to the [valientes] of libya the start to rebuild their country apos said [kerry]
apos is a claim of support [bipartidista] for their aspirations democratic apos
the language can appear [inofensivo] but nothing on the debate on libya has been easy to now
this summer the legislators of both parties is [peleaban] between yes and with the home white on the significant of a series of resolutions for approve or reject the role of the military of us us in the mission of the nato in libya
in june [kerry] and [mccain] tabled a resolution that forming the use limited of forces military of us us in libya
the project of law was [derrotado] in the house for a broader for [bipartidista] and that never came to [votarse] in the senate
but the same day in that the project of law was rejected in the house the house also rejected a measure that would [recortado] the funds for the operations americans in libya
what he the mission of us us in a kind of purgatory legislative with the congress what enough upsetting as for criticise the within for part of obama of the mission but not so [enfadado] as for in reality [segar] the [hierba] under their feet
to continuation the [indecisión] the congress was [superada] for the events
[trípoli] fell in hands of the rebels who in august and gaddafi was murdered the 20 of october
the mission of the nato end officially the 31 of october
now the senate could be completed for act
the resolution the committee of affairs foreign apos welcomes the people of libya for their [tremendo] courage and extraordinary resistance for shake to yes ourselves apos and apos commends to the men and women of the forces armed of states united and to their partners of the coalition that took in operations military for protect the people of libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism apos
the resolution also apos states the interest national of the states united in a successful and multi transition towards the democracy in libya apos
do going the new measure the completely support of the commission of affairs foreign or [dividirá] to the legislators as was the project of law of june
the last version was rejected for the senator richard g place [indiana] the main [republicano] the committee
the spokesman of place said the monday that not had seen still the version end the new project of law
the another on the nerve the house is to vote this week on a amendment constitutional demanding a budget balanced a priority legislative for almost all the [congresistas] republican and some democrats
the measure [patrocinada] for the [republicano] geldof [goodlatte] [republicano] for virginia will the first amendment constitutional on the budget or any another issue that of fact [logre] a vote of whole the house in the house or the senate in this congress
other legislators not have had success to the time for to to their amendments to the house but not for lack of attempts
the of [goodlatte] is only a of the 68 amendments constitutional that is have wonderful in this congress that [abarcan] a wider range of subjects
some are [duplicados] the same project of law is proposes therefore in the house as in the senate and other with small shift between yes
there for what least 15 versions of the amendment the balance budgetary so only in the house and another handful that apos orbit the expenditure federal apos
some of these projects of law also are [idénticos] between yes but are to their [patrocinadores] on all republican job that for [refinar] their [currículums] the opportunity of [jactarse] of that them were the apos authors apos of this measure
the law of control of budget that was adopted in august [requirió] that therefore the house as the senate voted a amendment the balance budgetary
in march 58 [senadores] voted to favour of a resolution not binding that supports the idea of that amendment
more beyond the budget several member want limit the number of [mandatos] that the member the congress can to while that the representative josé and [serrano] democrat for new york to validity the limit of two [mandatos] for the presidents
the representative [jesse] l jackson [jr] democrat for illinois has proposed a series of amendments that an the right to a education of quality and attention health between other subjects
a amendment that prohibits the marriage homosexual is a proposal [perenne] so as a that prohibits the burning of flags
some legislators also want allow the written of the laws federal if are been for two thirds of the states
so enthusiasts that have been the member to the time of propose amendments not is are strings to a pace more quickly that in years previous
in the [111º] congress the legislators proposed 77 amendments and tabled 66 in the [110º]
the pace is unacceptable in compared with the of the the of 1990 when the member were regularly more of 150 amendments every two years according figures [proporcionadas] for the library the senate
but not had a more success then of what that what have now
the last amendment that is added the 27 was void in 1992 but of fact was proposal for the congress in [1789]

the walls have eyes how the researchers you are at in facebook
before of become in the new face of the extreme right in europe anders [behring] [breivik] was simply another kind that [aireaba] their points of view anti immigration in line
the monday [breivik] who deed have done a killing in norway in july that he 77 dead is apos to their first hearing legal public
while [breivik] can have action only was far of be only in the [ciberespacio] had last the greater part the time that preceded to their attack with to their computer [charlando] with some of the million of nationalists that support to the groups of right in networks social
after of the tragedy of this summer the researchers wanted know more about of these people
but do how [encontrarlas]
easy only you that into in facebook
apos we we account of that not was so difficult to to them apos says [jamie] [bartlett] author main of a report published recently on the populism digital european for the centre of studies british let
the [alijo] of information personal of facebook is so [enciclopédico] says [bartlett] that the researchers could simply use the tool of advertising for determine their characteristics [demográficas] [deseadas] with a precision scientific the way that the sellers have state being for years
the team of [bartlett] found half million of fan of the groups of right in whole europe and then them [dirigieron] announcements but in place of [vincularles] to a new bandwidth or product of [dieta] the announcements [invitaban] to the users to complete a survey that he on their level education attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on their own future
the to to through of facebook [bartlett] and their colleagues were able of to to more of 10 000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 countries european all without out of the office
apos is a way completely new of to a research apos says [bartlett]
some of the results not are the all surprising the supporters in line of the groups of right tend to be young men and [enfadados] for the immigration
without however in a kind of issuing apos those that combined their [activismo] in line with the [activismo] outside of line are more reasonable more democratic and least violent that those that is are behind of the screen the computer apos
the work of let is only a example of how facebook is is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists
centres of research researchers doctors and scientists political are being the website for to all since problems of health to trends social such as is s in the apos i like apos messages in the walls and updates of state
with more of 800 million of users active [agregando] a average of three parts of content the day the apos [supernova] of data apos of facebook is and a on of the research pushing the number of jobs academic with the name the website in the title to almost a 800 in the last five years
for some researchers the beauty of facebook is that you allows to to the people to the that not [podías] [acercarte] with a [carpeta] in the street
apos before when [intentabas] [encuestar] to people the party national british was very difficult [identificarlos] apos
apos [tendrías] that go to through the party and them never you creation the access apos says [bartlett]
apos facebook would all that you to them directly apos
other say that the website could provide a way of identify and address the problems of health social
a study recent done for the [doctora] [megan] tan of the university of [wisconsin] [madison] and their colleagues found that the students it that they of their [hazañas] of [borrachera] in facebook they a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink that the students that refused in silence on the issue
tan suggests that the colleagues of the students such as the dispatches [residenciales] could control the website and intervene for help to a student that publish too updates of state with their binge
apos not you try a problem if not what you [diagnosticar] apos said tadeusz [christakis] the ltd author of tan and director the centre of health behaviour and development the child in the institute of research child of seattle said the washington post
apos we found a way of identify children in risk that of another way not would [diagnosticados] apos
facebook also is constantly apos [pinchando] apos to their own population for obtain data
the team of data the website has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the day of st on the expectation of participation electoral to half the period legislative of 2010 and a rate of Škottová national mainly being the information to the that is can access defenders of the freedom digital ago a time that maintain that the website should to to available of other their great amount of data for the research
without however the users of facebook know that the website them is looking them like or not the [sacrificio] for power playing the [scrabble] with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that the website [mine] your information personal
but do what is when the users of facebook spend to be part of a survey that not even know
while that the researchers have guidelines well defined on how up their data outside of line in line is a [barra] free for all
apos not i that many of the users have considered even in the fact of that a researchers could be examining their profiles apos says outskirts [selwyn] a todd the laboratory of knowledge of london on a study of 2006 that was to out with the walls public of facebook of students
apos in what that to them precise was only between them and their friends apos
then is the question of the methodology
even outside of line not there guarantee of that a issue of research this being completely honest
in facebook is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a user and of the messages the wall are truth
apos what that [dices] in facebook and what that pensioner outside of facebook are two things completely different apos says [selwyn]
is for that that to despite of their years as researchers of the technology [selwyn] believes that a [sujetapapeles] and a [bolígrafo] are being the best tools of research that no can use
apos not there substitute for into in the world real and about with the people real apos says
apos the research social is is that is on what social and a lot of what social still is outside of line apos

do what them say to their more [fervientes] followers
thank for remain to our on to through of all these years
we took almost 21 years to to at rich thank for have expected therefore and [lamentamos] that we has taken therefore time in to to there
any people even already is as to their of as the shows more large the year
do you adds that a little of pressure to their visit
some of the [shows] more large that we [tocado] for the last 21 years [sucedieron] for the last couple of weeks
[tocamos] a couple of [shows] [gigantescos] in [sao] [paulo] and we that that we has since in way for this of in at rich
of truth we very finns of play there
[amamos] that country we love [surfear] and the [jungla] for both things at rich is between the best the world
do how was that as at rich and their waves for [surfear]
we many friends that are [surfeadores] and i a great friend that lives in [tamarindo] and the waves there are s
my friends always is would to [surfear] to at rich and nicaragua together with mexico are large places for [surfear] so was how we [enteramos] for half of people that old the [surf]
the see the this have come [entregando] [shows] enormous with many songs
do what have [planeado] for their presentation in at rich
as never we [tocado] there before then not we no restriction on what that we to
[intentaremos] give the better shows possible with a good variety of songs through of play a couple of songs of every georgian and them to our fan a good and diverse [repertorio]
you never are the [repertorio]
do to what is must this
i that is partially because we nine disks and we play more of 120 songs and to every one you them different songs so that is difficult decisions what songs play every night
when we two or three songs in the [repertorio] that have pink of not play that we in [enfocados] and also we in surprised because we reminds the reasons for the that we [gustaban] these songs and that is we could have neglected
that ago that the shows be more interesting for us and for therefore i that also what again more interesting for the people
with this this are there 20 years of very
the look back do is difficult of believe all what that have achieved
yes absolutely
in first place i that none of us is meaning that we in a great bandwidth of simonyi and have fact for more of 20 years ago that some as a dream
we up our [bendiciones] and we [emociona] a that we to doing music together
all we we and we love create music
we lucky of go to places the world to the that always [quisimos] go
the things not could be better for us
do what meant for you the have been part fundamental the emergence the [grunge]
always has been a honour be part of that group of large gangs
we very friends of the people of [soundgarden] [mudhoney] and [alice] in [chains]
is surprising when a movement from of a group of friends and is something little common
of time in when from a bandwidth of a city but is a more strange when five or ten gangs out the same time of a same city
we proud and honest of be part the group of seattle
still [tocamos] with some of them of time in when
the year last we in a festival with [alice] in [chains] and we in canada with [mudhoney] we to [soundgarden] in their this so that we lucky of be friends of all them still and we honour be part of that audio of seattle that about
also is very strange that a bandwidth as the of you is keep united and with the ourselves member for therefore time
yes four of us we we together for 21 years and [matt] cameron is we joined ago 13 years what which for yes only is a more time the that removal many gangs
in first place i that all we lucky of be still with life and in second all we into for the others
all we friends very those and thank to that also is have open [avenidas] music that you are freedom to every one of shares
we we the a to the other with the music of every one and not could be better
the relationship of you with the word reputation not has been simple without however thank to their success have been to what that want
do how are a balance
to as we gone growing has been more easy find a balance
we ensure of that not be too of this because is easy fall in that game of the large [multitudes] and of the people that old your music
while one democrat that the people is there for the music that you democrat that she respect the music and what that the brought without [encapricharse] for be famous and be a simonyi [star] something that to none of us really you interested
do how reminds their another project [mother] [love] [bone]
i that [escribimos] very good songs and the principle was something under
were a bandwidth for almost three years and never tracing a [disco] to that after of that [muriera] [andy] symeou [woods]
there many [frustraciones] because [durara] therefore and what more important is that still we very friends of [bruce] [fairweather] and greg [gilmore] that they in the bandwidth with us and when hear a song or i a photograph i in the incredible person that [andy] was and how i was laugh always was a pleasure go to work [reírnos] about of music and [futbol] and a more
was a be human surprising and what [extrañamos]
the bandwidth national the [robertas] will the committed of open the shows in at rich
do is true that you know their work in special [eddie] [vedder] and that for that the [escogieron] for the opening
yes the production we sent [videos] with several proposals and that was the bandwidth that more we pleased so that we finns of see what that the [robertas] can offer in live and duty be very apos
do for what always period the lyrics of [yellow] [ledbetter] in live
that is a question for [ed] [eddie] [vedder] so that not i
he the singing and i that what ago with what first that is you happen
do as [bajista] what are their sucrose
are many
within of the first that is i occur are [geezer] [butler] john [entwistle] c j [ramone] john [doe] paul [mccartney] [chuck] [dukowski]
are many that could about whole the later on the [bajistas] that i crazy
do how has achieved [pearl] [jam] keep relevant the [grunge] to despite of not be already a fashionable
i that all us always we we a little [desconectados] of the word [grunge]
when i in she i reminds the gangs that given before as [mudhoney] [soundgarden] [nirvana] and all the that ems the same time and if there relevant now i that is something marvellous because is music that is the it listen and gangs as [mudhoney] are doing now better music that never
the principle their music had a content more dark and now is has again more positive
do to what is must this change
is interesting because i that there a couple of songs in the new georgian that such time unimaginable more [livianas] but also there songs as the [end] or [just] [breathe] that as as songs very shameful although can sound a little positive
with both when [ed] i the [tocó] [lloré] when the i and are songs deeply shameful
i that when [creces] and there some [trauma] in your life and is lose to a family or a friend these things start to movement your art and your music and these two songs without doubt represent that for me
also i that is can be a person happy and still so power to music that be whites

with the death of the [cmb] in 1987 the park the to [situarse] in the imaginary of many as the limit higher of barcelona being the capital [catalana] of the few that not is [orientan] in the s north south but down mountain from sea
the rating of [collserola] as park natural apos in this idea
the reference already not was central [park] but [yellowstone] with the [jabalís] in the role the [oso] [yogi]
in these is was to that in september the city [convocó] a [megacompetición] an for 16 notice for other many doors of access to [collserola]
a door planned to the idea of park without doubt
or that or someone to to doors the field
the question its single [collserola] do park or mountain
the contest therefore for their it merely [organizativa] as for what that is of reflection on the city is the issue of conversation between all the architects [barceloneses]
is almost already a issue recurrent the that to hand when two member of this former untouchables of elected is recognise in a lift
and this fact of ordinary exactly to a of the few [coincidencias] between what that opinion three architects [barceloneses] and teachers it that is have presented
miguel [roldán] daniel [mòdol] and [marta] [bayona] the contest is right
for [roldán] after addressed the with shallow apos is ago necessary apos discuss on apos the with of mountain apos whole time that the speech of [ildefons] [cerdà] the of the premium greens not is has taken to out
apos is from of the basis of that the park more trout of barcelona is the a
between other things for their great [accesibilidad]
[collserola] is more complex apos ruling the architect for who the title of apos doors of [collserola] apos within a apos trap [léxica] apos not there that think in them apos as the [accesos] to a park but the [delimitación] of a areas where there that act apos
[mòdol] as [roldán] and [bayona] with experience in the world [urbanístico] described the proposal of apos challenge intellectual apos with apos some dangers apos
dangers derivatives of what apos uncertain that is today day project the space public apos after the experience [vivida] in the 80 and that had in the area the [fòrum] apos their enemy the [cisne] apos
the first fear is the own [delimitación] of a borders on where is can build
apos limit something is them already the next step apos is say their [sobrepaso]
apos there that think in new instruments [urbanísticos] of planning because the current apos in reference the plan general [metropolitano] [pgm] 93 can give ordinary to [auténticos] disasters apos
more [ceñido] to the question [mòdol] view that [simplificando] the it [vallesana] of [collserola] apos can should as a park the of barcelona not apos for a question merely [topográfica]
[mòdol] reminds that already there a work fact for the [patronat] of [collserola] that apos not must fall in together it apos although thanks the opportunity that the city offers to their [gremio] of intervene in this project apos since the first time apos
and still more understand that the [cercanía] of the mountain with the city is the police that allows to the architects into in the debate but apos doubt apos on if is this profile technical the that must lead the equipment [multidisciplinarios] apos all a likewise apos as that is have had that create apos the architects should be only a tool apos
[bayona] nothing that the answer to the question that of title to this one is complex because in the foundations the contest lack a vision global of [collserola] apos is have swiss 16 notice direct says in the sense mountain sea but not there a reading [longitudinal] that see and understands the area in their whole apos
this from the least in their case that has choice for participate in the 16 notice

the [reportes] in the [aicm] [ubicaban] conditions right the sleep with is the [aeronave] towards the area deeply between the [df] and the state of mexico is were facilitated of [nubosidad] to low all
routes [seleccionadas]
is likely that for the conditions of [nubosidad] the [tripulación] has [buscada] a area of will raising and greater visibility towards the valley of [cuernavaca]
location the impact
the [coordenadas] of impact and the last registration of the [aeronave] the sit line probably before the impact not there loss of control not at in the very of flight
[dispersión] of remains of the [aeronave] in a area reduced
the information available to the time it mean that the impact happened in a very straight and of on
the [patrón] of [dispersión] of remains of the [aeronave] it mean that the helicopter is [impactó] in the ground in conditions of integrity structural
not is has been obvious of ceasefire or explosion
in the website the are are without [revelarse] [evidencias] in the remains of the [nave] of some kind of explosion or ceasefire
the last results of the research show that could have had multiple contacts with the ground
for the jobs of field is have found parts of the [aeronave] to a raising of 9 billion 200 feet on the level half the sea the ground is a outstanding that is since the seven degrees to 30 degrees of gradient
the photographs show the sequence in the that expected is [desarticuló] to what long of said way
the information being elements that seem indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple [impactos] in the ground
after of the search cleared in a area more wider that the website [acordonado] around the accident not is have found parts pieces of the [aeronave] what that strengthens the presumption of that the impact is presented in conditions of integrity structural
[mss] opening protocol for finding gene of obesity
at the sure social a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young is supported in specialists the [ipn]
the institute mexican the sure social [imss] announced that at a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young called protocol apos genetic of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence apos that will have with [marcadores] with the obesity
in a release the head of the unit of research medical in [bioquímica] the hospital of [especialidades] the centre doctor national century 21st miguel cross valverde he that is house a team [multidisciplinario] of doctors nurses [nutriólogos] and workers social
said team is supported for specialists and a of [postgrado] the institute national of health public [insp] and the centre of research and of studies advanced [cinvestav] the institute [politécnico] national [ipn]
in the research is taught to participate to the population be or not [derechohabiente] come to the units sporting participants the [imss] in the valley of mexico where is have to out the evidence to the under all the i to from of the 8 m hours
skills that the protocol started in the unit integrating [cuauhtémoc] state of mexico [poniente] and that since the 8 of october the activity is has to out in the unit integrating [nezahualcóyolt] state of mexico east
a time that is question the aim of together to 500 or 600 under the study promoting in the unit integrating independence south the district federal and finally in the unit integrating [morelos] the north the district federal
he that the purpose of this research is know the components and the importance of the genetic with regard the development of the obesity and identify in children and young interest factors of risk for prevent the emergence of diseases chronic [degenerativas]
the we this 14 of november the day world of the disease [precisó] that the aim is together to three billion children and young between six and 14 years of age with the consent and supervision of their parents for the implementation of [cuestionarios] specific on food
also is them [preguntará] on the activity physical and background [heredofamiliares] of diseases with the purpose of avoid factors of risk that [desencadenen] [padecimientos] as disease or inadequacy [renal]
[detalló] that the i is them applies to all the participants measurements [antropométricas] weight stature circumference of [cintura] decision of pressure instances determination of the levels of [glucosa] [triglicéridos] [colesterol] and insulin and genetic is search identify genes that is [asocien] to the obesity child
cross valverde pointed that this research temper to the concern of the professionals of the health for the alarming increase of weight in the under
apos the surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 signal that in so only six years there a increase in the case of the children of 77 for cent in obesity and of the girls of 47 for cent in terms of obesity also is observed a rise dramatic apos skills the specialist the [imss]
pressed that the justification for the search of the [marcadores] is [sustenta] in that the population the country from of other for their history genetic
informed that in average the mexican has 65 for cent of inheritance indian american 30 for cent european and five for cent african and this condition is reflects in the genes that is take to disease and too of weight
he that of way general the genetic of the obesity is translates in the inability of bath the too of energy that [consumimos] lowcalorie and that is transported in way of blubber
the researchers he that the benefit direct for the participants is the assessment embracing of the children what that allows detect if have some degree of obesity or obesity
even said the presence of [pliegues] of colour [obscuro] [acantosis] in bottleneck and [antebrazo] that show the likelihood of that [padezca] [alteraciones] [metabólicas] and to [prediabetes]
the information is apos of way confidential the doctors the [entregan] for writing to the parents to who is them explains every a of the measurements and the changes in the lifestyle of life that must to for prevent diseases
cross valverde he that there three components main that cause obesity obesity and other [padecimientos] [crónicos] the [sedentarismo] that is the lack of activity physical day remain the greater part the day at with the television and use media of transport in place of i travel planes
also is must to the high [ingesta] [calórica] is say the greater consumption of excess [azucaradas] of [carbohidratos] [tamales] bread [pizza] hamburger etc with high content in unprocessed and protein and the genetic that is analysing in this protocol
stains of the [unam] [evitaría] pretty
raphael [herrera] researchers of the faculty of chemistry of the [unam] develops [asfaltos] modified with [polímeros] for produce a a with better every regardless of the conditions environmental and of temperature
if the signals that are the [pavimento] like demands not would necessary [reparar] close of 200 billion pretty every season of dry in the area cause the valley of mexico warned raphael [herrera] [nájera] researchers of the faculty of chemistry [fq] of the [unam] who assured that if the process of construction and peacekeeping of a [pavimento] [asfáltico] is the appropriate the pretty could radioactivity in amount or even be for completely
in their conference a opinion technological of the pretty [dictada] in the framework the year international of the chemistry was to know that the laboratory to their office develops [asfaltos] modified with [polímeros] for produce a a with characteristics like to the the stains but with a greater resistance mechanics therefore to high as to low temperatures
[herrera] [nájera] [estimó] that this kind of [asfaltos] modified could used in places where the climate is extremely a as some cities the north the country for improve their every and for what therefore the training of pretty
he that the stains the part more disproportionately the oil is a whole of [moléculas] of [hidrocarburos] a of high weight [molecular] called [asfaltenos] and other of under weight [molecular] called [maltenos] that institutes you are the [pavimento] their characteristic behaviour [viscoelástico]
the behaviour [viscoelástico] the stains is in that to high temperatures close of the u degrees is means as a liquid to 120 degrees degree their [viscosidad] is very high and to 50 degrees degree is a state almost hardest while that to temperatures very low the stains is again [quebradizo] added
what previous means that in the streets the resistance the stains not is uniform but that is is constitutes for the day of agreement with the conditions environmental and of temperature warned the specialist in engineering chemistry
the researchers of the [fq] observed that the streets of the city of mexico in their majority are covered for [pavimento] flexible the which is consists of six facilitated of materials of the which the last three [involucran] the stains
between the facilitated more [superficiales] is is the [carpeta] [asfáltica] [conformada] for small stones [bañadas] in stains and then [compactadas]
every a of the [piedritas] that is the [carpeta] pointed is [bañada] with stains
the [transitar] the vehicles and [generarse] efforts this allows that the forces is are very well in the [pavimento]
if is like of stains amended is [difundirían] still better opinion the engineering chemical
on the [carpeta] [asfáltica] [abundó] is put a last as called [carpeta] of [rodadura] the which is made of a material of stone fine is say a bit that also is [baña] in stains
as is is of the as that is to be in contact with the [llantas] of the vehicles must have more force mechanics that the [carpeta] [asfáltica] and provide [fricción] in the way
the be the part the [pavimento] that is to receive and salvage the efforts the [carpeta] of [rodadura] required also have the thick appropriate and is must they the material the that is made
the climate especially the moisture and the shift of temperature also are a factor very important to be in special the water said because affects significantly the every of the [carpeta] [asfáltica]
when the ground is [humedece] the water is you in the internal of the [carpeta] and is difficult that from this level a [reblandecimiento] of all the facilitated the [pavimento] and for what therefore the training of pretty
in the process of training of a [bache] said the first in [desgastarse] is the film of [rodamiento] and only after is affects the [carpeta] [asfáltica] but the damage not happens [instantáneamente] but that is a process that should [atenderse] to the first signals with suitable programmes of peacekeeping
the also member the system national of researchers he that the burden [vehicular] is another factor important in the training of pretty and for this the thick of every a of the facilitated the [pavimento] must go always in relationship with the burden [vehicular] and ensure that is question for avoid that is train pretty responding
raphael [herrera] warned that still there a that with and work on the stains for example the [emulsiones] [asfálticas] that in other countries already is are even in the market and it [reparar] the pretty with easily and without need of use high temperatures
do what you wilfully to the cresson the valley for be the new [señorita] colombia
analysis of the factors that [incidieron] for that [melina] [ramírez] [serna] not [alcanzara] the nickel of [señorita] colombia
the valley a their title number 14 of princess
of new the valley the [cauca] is is with the wish of the nickel of [señorita] colombia
this time [melina] [ramírez] [serna] is had that shaping with be in the [podio] of [ganadoras] [lucir] the nickel of silver and the bandwidth that the [acreditan] as new princess of colombia
with the result obtained [anoche] in [cartagena] where the [señorita] atlantic is [alzó] with the nickel and the [cetro] the department already sum 14 titles of princess and [melina] is a to the legion of women [vallecaucanas] that have state close of the nickel but that were [proclamas] [princesas] between them of [ospina] [benoit] istrian clear [domínguez] [borrero] [1949] from [bellini] [ayala] 1979 was Álvarez 1981 [rose] mary [alzate] 1983 [olga] maría [arenas] 1987 [leila] [blanque] 1988 [mónica] [evers] 1989 maría [consuela] [pinedo] 1990 [diana] [isabel] [romero] 1993 [giselle] [garcés] [aljure] 2000 [catalina] [giraldo] 2007 [stephanie] [garcés] [aljure] 2008
today the great question that many is do is do what wilfully
because the result represents the defeat of a great [favorita] that in every presentation proved that she had all for be the new [señorita] colombia not in vain was elected as of the police and better face [jolie] of [vogue] titles that able [reinas] as [taliana] [vargas] or [natalia] [navarro] who is were the nickel of [señorita] colombia
the first factor that is as key in the decision that took the jury of [designarla] first princess latter in that not [convenció] with their answer to the question apos do what is that book that you has some to you and for what made for [martín] [murillo] [gómez] of the [carreta] [literaria] [leamos]
the [interrrogante] the [vallecaucana] replied
apos read a i quite in the literature i that is a way of [culturalizarse] definitely i that the book that i espoused of childhood is apos the [principito] apos is a book quite their
currently read apos crime and punishment apos is a book of literature universal that all we read and today in day i read the book of [irene] [nemirovski] a russian a book [hermosísimo] that is way apos the [ardor] of the blood apos apos
a answer that little pleased first for the term apos [culturalizarse] apos and second for not explain of way particular of what way every one of the books that [citó] the have some
but the by the ceremony [melina] manifested your relaxed and happy with the result apos the universe is [sabio] is what that has that to
and for whole the people for favour read a [poquito] apos the [principito] apos is a great book apos
between the [hipótesis] been is says that to valley the [quemó] the [favoritismo]
a journalist [bogotano] [insinuó] that the be the theories the [ovacionada] and the cresson that is was all the prizes preliminary challenge of [gastronomía] [oster] vote the public for the better suit notions and as mother apos that kindled the [celos] of the other has [estresó] to the as and for that not [brilló] in the stage apos
and that is [notó] in their first presentation in suit of bathing in the a the [hilton] and their two [desfiles] in the evening of [coronación]
although in both [lució] safe is [notó] that you missing the force and the impetus that the representatives of [magdalena] and atlantic yes presevo
ariel [osorio] journalist the programme apos as in home apos the channel [rcn] opinion that the fact of that [melina] outside abroad princess apos apparent that the cresson that more prizes earns for the contest not is as as apos
also valley is was to what last very [esquiva] with the press and there is [equivocó]
other [hipótesis] is that valley not in to the jury on their interest towards the work social that is in last the essence the contest national of beauty
for something two days before of the election the jury international [lucy] [doughty] manifested that them [buscaban] a woman [comprometida] with the needs social of their [pais]
apos the beauty single not enough in a [miss] colombia there that look region beyond of what physical and firstly in their sensitivity social that before of imply the contest are already [involucradas] in projects apos he
also is [especula] that valley [pecó] for their s in the [derriere] and the [fibrosis] that is you [notaba] in their [abdomen] but is planetary therefore precisely the jury the was as the cresson apos beauty natural apos with the body more healthy good food and work physical responsible
the [preparador] of [reinas] george [hernán] [orozco] recognised that [melina] not had the better body that had best apos but their problem of [fibrosis] in the [abdomen] that the truth for my not was very [notoria] you struggle points in the last day apos
between therefore the journalist guido [hoyos] of the magazine [cromos] as that the mistake of the [vallecaucana] were the speeches [quirúrgicas] that is [practicó]
apos the [cirugías] are well but valley not is the it to
their body never was their strong and here is the [cobraron] apos
for this prize that for first time over the contest national of the beauty after the belonging in suit of bathing about a trapping [vaticinio] that [anoche] is properly therefore is said that this was the [contentillo] that [raymundo] you [concedía] to [melina] for not i the will of the nickel
reality or not what true is that [melina] since today starts a year of [reinado] not as sovereign but as princess position that you offered the possibility of represent to colombia in one of the [certámenes] international for designation the own contest national
without however she will to the history as a of the [reinas] that to despite of their [arrollador] step for [cartagena] you was [esquiva] the nickel
so was the work the [caleño] that lighthouse the [cadáver] of [alfonso] [cano]
a [lofoscopista] of [cali] happened to the history as the man that this the death of apos [alfonso] [cano] apos
the work of these officials is key
the last 4 of november a [lofoscopista] the [cti] of [cali] happened to the history as the man that this the identity the maximum head of the [farc] apos [alfonso] [cano] apos to through the [cotejo] of their fingerprinting digital

the week the operational against [alias] [alfonso] [cano] to [eliazar] you warned that on clothes minimum for three days
something large you than
the friday in the night went for the [cauca] in a helicopter since [palmira]
was that should identify two bodies and that is [sospechaba] that one of them was the man that schuman to the [guerrilla] more former the world for what that you ’ that on the card [decadactilar] of psychologist a [sáenz] their real name
without however when came with the team of research the website in the that is was the [cadáver] not what recognised for their aspect physical therefore was very different the that had seen in the media of communication
was without [barba] clothing as a plead of the area without glasses and a more slip
but the fingerprinting not [mienten]

that same night the man [oriundo] of port [tejada] was the responsibility of [confirmarle] the minister of defence juan seat [pinzón] that yes is was the maximum head of the [farc]

for a [dactiloscopista] of the [sijín] of [cali] the recognition that was the president juan manuel holy to [eliazar] gonzález in the wheel of press for the operational against apos [cano] apos is very significant
very people not known our work
the [dactiloscopia] is a science accurate without for of mistake that can to to be key in the resolution of crimes
from of the identification of bodies the [lofoscopistas] support research for crimes as [hurto] and murder and chicago the identity of the people [capturadas]
when is dover many criminals have [cédulas] wishful or not have papers
us them we the impression [dactilar] and the look in the basis of data
the researchers counted that in a case of [hurto] you [tocó] validity a part of wall of a home therefore in that place the do had supported their hand for from a box strong full of [joyas] and money
apos the walls are difficult because not are land [apropiadas] for from a impression [dactilar] but in that case we obtain the left of whole the hand and identify the criminal that had participated in different [hurtos] apos reminded
the fingerprinting also can seeking or reaffirm suspected in cases of murder
ago little found to a man died with wise of [licor] to their around
for half of the research is [determinó] that a family could be suspect the crime and indeed a left in the bottleneck [coincidía]
although this not does that has been the murderer yes what [ubica] in the scene the crime
a [dactiloscopista] the [cti] he that in the items apos the fingerprinting is [sacan] with [reactivos] chemical or physical apos
when officer is used a [transplantador] or tape for [levantarlas]

the motion on the presidency of the commission european proposal for the direction is adopted virtually for unanimity
of the 1 [001] delegates so only is registered nine votes in against and ten [abstenciones]
the [standing] [ovation] of several minutes that is [ganaron] with their speeches withdraw withdraw and after several hours [wolfgang] [schäuble] the [eurófilo] minister of finance [despejan] any doubt possible
the idea key of the chancellor and of the motion is short in a motto the answer to the crisis apos not is least europe but more europe apos
not only because europe is the peace but also because apos nine million of jobs on directly the euro apos
for the chancellor apos has come the time of open way in europe apos
this could motivational in amendments the treaty of lisbon for allow strengthen the control of the union european on the policies budgetary of the countries of the area the euro although also could [desembocar] in the election the president of the commission european for suffrage universal for apos i a face to europe apos
in all case that is a of the proposals of the motion adopted for the congress clearly idea of [wolfgang] [schäuble]
without doubt is little likely that the bringing are quickly to a agreement on this change radical great britain is shows hostile to he and the leaders of the cdu seem know that [nicolas] sarkozy also
but the accept is on the ground

unless of last
still that ago two centuries is in a bloody battle in thumbs
of fact was a of the [derrotas] more humiliating for the army of rostopchine
the impact the fraud in the low for disease
after the benefits the [ump] and the government [emprenden] a for against the low for disease
[nicolas] sarkozy will the tuesday 15 of november in bordeaux for visiting a box responsible of the benefits family and pronounce a speech on the issue already recurrent since 2007 of the fight against the fraud social and the [ayudantía]
also for her such for that part of the will of save of way thorough but still so reminds to a s of the campaign presidential of right the majority to firstly in the low for disease
in first place for apply cuts budgetary the government for impose to the workers the sector private a fourth day of we before of power take the low
in final unless that there a convention of company specific a worker that [caiga] ill lose four days of wage is say a minimum the 15 of their income month
is is of a measure that could on a wave of ira but that would save [280] million of eur according them [echos]
also would accompanied of other measure with a reach more symbolic impose to the officials a day of we without remains in case of low labour to the time not have we with to the three days that is apply in the sector private
while is [debaten] these issues the majority again to to on the table also the issue the fraud this time looking towards the abuses of the low labour
apos will to [incrementarse] significantly the controls and also if is which to someone planned a fraud must [reembolsar] the [cuantías] apos warned [xavier] [bertrand] about in the [rtl] the sunday 13 of november
the as that in the other cases the effects the announcement seem slightly [desproporcionados] for the reality the fraud in on of low labour
of fact since 2002 is for a up constant of this question and is have it various offensive policies that normally have given as
the french not [enferman] more that in the rest of europe
handed with attention in first place the figures national
according the institute french of the security social [cnam] in 2006 is [abonaron] more of [237] million of eur in particular for low labour
according the institute french of research and documents in economy of the health the benefits for the low [representaron] in 2008 the 5 the expenditure health [ascendiendo] to 11 300 million of eur
of this sum the 46 is to the low for leave and for accidents labour while that the 54 is related with the low for disease figure that out to 6 200 million of eur
for therefore the 2 5 the expenditure in health
in 2010 the french have [cogido] a average of 14 5 days of low labour with to 17 8 in 2009 according a study the group soul [consulting]
a average that without doubt behind government other survey published in 2007 for the syrian of management professional [monster] com [mostraba] that the 75 of the 40 000 workers french [encuestados] rushing that not had [cogido] not a only day of low for disease
another study in this case of the [assurance] [maladie] points that in 2010 the 37 of the low for disease had a term than to 8 days the 22 of between 8 and 14 days the 15 of between 15 days and a month the 15 of between one and three months and the 11 were more extended
if the compared with our neighbours european the workers french not are more [propensos] that in other areas to take low for disease
a long study done in 2010 for two researchers the [cnrs] top that between 1994 and 2001 the rate of lack global the work therefore for reasons of health as of another kind [oscilaba] in france between the 10 and the 11 with to a 20 and a 28 in denmark a 15 in uk uk or between a 16 and a 18 in the countries netherlands
the fraud in the low for disease not is especially significant in compared with the work not declared
the fraud has a reach quite limited
the forward of the legislation since 2002 has caused that the controls of the low for disease of more of 45 days are [sistemáticos]
in 2008 of 1 5 million of inspections the [cnam] [comprobó] in a 13 of the [285] 000 by that the low of short term were apos gaps or too we apos is say 37 [050] cases
in the case of the low of more of 45 days untreated to inspections [sistemáticas] is was that the 11 of the cases were apos rightly [adaptados] or [injustificados] a figure that taking as starting a total of 1 2 million out to preliminary 000
for therefore is high a total of 169 000 cases apos [injustificados] apos between several million of workers that [cogieron] a low for disease
without doubt a figure it in compared for example with the work in black
according the member of the [ump] [dominique] [tian] author of a report on this question in june this practice will a losses of income tax of between 9 000 and 15 000 million of eur the year is say more that the cost total of the benefits for low and without doubt significantly more that the fraud in this last area

policy energy
the facts must assert more that the undistorted
if there a issue that not is can try taking in account considerations of short term or simply thinking in the emotion is the policy energy
the availability and the cost of the electricity on directly in the power purchasing and in the competitiveness of the companies
is appropriate that a i electoral be the time of think on such issues and on the place of the energy nuclear
the debate only will useful if investigated the whole of the consequences economic social and environmental of the options proposals
the french must resorted their opinion in facts objectives in data rational
now that we 7 000 million of people in the planet the development demographic some the duplication of the demand we before of 2050 to least that is [prive] to a huge part of the population world of a element vital
the same time will that unsustainability the shortage every time greater of the resources fossil for to have electricity continually without forget the [imperiosa] need of reduce the emissions of gases of effect greenhouse for fight against the change climate a issue that has disappeared the debate ecological
the accident of [fukushima] not change none of these parameters
for that germany it single in their decision of up to the energy nuclear
that not is the case not of belgium that hearing the their to the need of find a source capable of [sustituirla] not of switzerland that only has for aim build central of last generation
for another on great britain finland poland republic czech countries netherlands sweden africa china india and brazil for quote some examples are forward with determination with their projects
the states united for their on after [fukushima] you add a unit to their park [retomando] the construction of a central [interrumpida] after the accident of [three] [mile] [island]
if the model german based in the energy renewable is is in times as example the reality is in against of such speech
the election of berlin is to mean a [encarecimiento] the price of the electricity a greater on energy for the need [incrementada] of gas imported in particular of russia a increase of the emissions of co2 for the construction of central of gas and of coal
in a months is [notarán] the effects harmful
must [meditarse] on the case of denmark
[campeón] of europe in the sector [eólico] the which this the 30 of their electricity also is one of the large users of coal and of gas because to the [intermitencia] the wind for this reason their emissions of co2 and the price of their electricity are respectively a 65 and a 50 more high that the average european
for the contrary thank to the have of our policy energy our neighbours [abonan] a bill of electricity a 40 higher to the of the who french
while that in a economy restructurings the cost of the energy is a factor key of the competitiveness and a guarantee the peacekeeping of the usefulness industrial in the territory national the companies french is benefit of the electricity more cheap of europe
for that reason any reduction significantly of the energy nuclear contribute a strong takes the price of the electricity what that [restaría] realism to the [maravillosas] statements on the [reindustrialización] of our country and the defence of our power purchasing
is is of a price that the great majority of the french is refuse to pay and of fact not [manifiestan] opposition for principle to that kind of energy according show the surveys
remember that the policy energy of our country has lost build a sector industrial with twenty 000 jobs of work director and [410] 000 jobs [indirectos]
widely looking to the export encompasses a galaxy of [pymes] specialist in the markets international and that can create jobs not [deslocalizables]
if france [decidiese] leave the energy nuclear contribute the [sacrificio] of great part of these smes and the loss of the 6 000 million of eur year in exports french of equipment and services nuclear
do what [electricista] [encargaría] a [epr] designed for work sixty years when is to the collapse of their manufacturer
for right the equation of the energy nuclear there that admit that not there a source miracle of production of electricity the as that not there a source [diabólica]
the development for part of [areva] of solutions with low emissions of co2 nuclear and renewable shows the nature awareness of the sources of energy
in the case of the energy nuclear is essential keep the maximum level of security
in france we of a authority of security that has a control narrower and transparent therefore on the central existing as on the construction of [flamanville]
our equipment of recognised professionalism are also obsessed for the security
in half century the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious
so only one the of [three] [mile] [island] is in in a conditions operational normal not resulted consequences not for the people not for the half environment
in chernobyl the accident is was the design the sink and to a failures human [imperdonables]
in [fukushima] some people seem forget that the accident is was to two disasters natural of a reach without unprecedented that wave the death of tens of thousands of people
the sector nuclear [aprenderá] of this accident such as what was of the two previous
thank to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security and the operators and seating french and germans the [epr] is a design capable of [resistir] to such phenomena
while what [estudian] all the players electric that want build a central the interruption of their construction in [flamanville] would a great gift for the competitors of [areva] and [edf] since that them commodities to free for in the leadership in the inevitable development the sector nuclear
is essential and legitimate to the best options [energéticas] for our country but would irresponsible to that the ambivalent the undistorted and the volume [partisanas] [dominasen] a debate so important for the situation economic social and financial of our country
the immigration do a burden or a opportunity for the economy
the policy of immigration roundly for [nicolas] sarkozy has been [criticada] that since various points of view the [saturación] of the services police judicial and administrative subject to the policy of figures the doubts of this policy with the statute [autoproclamado] of apos country of the rights human apos of france
more recently is the harassment administrative of the students foreign the that has [saltado] to the headlines with the minister of internal [véase] the newspaper [libération] the 23 of may [proclamando] of last that france apos not needs [talentos] foreign workers not [camareros] apos
without however rarely time is analysing since the point of view economic
the question is that on this issue there quite consensus between the left and the right
in the case of the right jacques chirac [fijó] the it [declarando] in 1976 that apos 900 000 unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with close of two million of workers immigrants apos while that in the left the tone what [fijó] michel rocard [explicando] that france apos not can done office of whole the misery the world apos in 1990
the only difference the degree of generosity
in 2005 therefore the left as the right [compartían] the fear to the invasion the territory national for a a of [fontaneros] poles
to both both is as that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society french
the only difference is in the degree of generosity with the that act with regard to the immigrants
in their programme vichy [hollande] is limited to include [banalidades] those that the [codesarrollo] will right the apos problem of the migration apos
this idea of the immigration as a burden a problem perhaps is why [electoralmente] but economically its very face
such as guarding the economists shoulder [goldin] and [geoffrey] cameron in a labour recent that sums the knowledge more recent on the immigration [exceptional] [people] [how] [migration] [shaped] [our] world and [will] it [our] [future] may of 2011 [princeton] university stocking [352] [pp] there a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive of the flows migratory in the growth economic the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants
the restrict of the immigration it the growth and particularly the employment
the fears related with the impact of the immigrants is based in the idea of that these can replace to the workers national in particular to the little would pressing for that is reduce their wages
but the experience shows that in reality the immigrants are more well additional that substitutes of the workers national and use mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment
the immigrants little would working in sectors that not by to workers national and the more would in sectors dynamic where the training not is the demand of personal
a effect positive on the wages
the same way that a vladmir would difficulties for work in a country that have lack of [anestesistas] the [complementariedad] between national and immigrants from that the arrival of these last chance welcome in the wages and the employment of the national
taking in account what previous [giovanni] [peri] [calculó] that a increase the 1 of the flows migratory is a takes of the wages real to long term of between a 0 6 and a 0 9
and without have in account the fact of that the diversity that [aportan] the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and the growth economic there a great proportion of prizes nobel americans [naturalizados] and companies as google [intel] [paypal] [ebay] and yahoo were suspicions for immigrants
the immigrants also are taxpayers dig to the systems social since that [aportan] of average a 1 the budget total in the countries european
the organisation international the work estimated for example that in germany a immigrant that it with a age of 30 years operators a contribution [neta] income least expenditure of 150 000 eur to the budgets public of average for whole their life
the principle of their mandate [nicolas] sarkozy wanted go to to the points of growth that you [faltaban] apos with the tooth apos
these tooth that [disuadieron] to the immigrants had exactly the effect swede
europe invented the democracy only you lack think in a democracy european
the democracy is a well precious but also fragile
the continent european should power [acordarse] of this already that although is invented in athens ago more of two billion years to what long the century twentieth has suffered the tragedies of the war world [totalitarismos] the holocaust the exalted but also to very in spain to salazar in portugal the [coroneles] in greece
some perhaps believed that for that the democracy [triunfase] definitely on their enemies would enough as the vote and the way more direct possible
know since rostopchine apos the small apos that is was of something considered
the suffrage universal although is is of a condition necessary for the democracy not is enough for yes only and even can become in a apos instrument of oppression apos as said found the [filósofo] [republicano] [etienne] [vacherot]
not the democracy required a more a space public a spirit public values a organisation a separation and a control of the powers a education go solidarity economic and social justice
the crisis that we in europe is a crisis economic but is to point of become in a crisis policy and democratic
the [palinodia] the referendum greek real untrue had to this regard a double effect intend was the need of a return take of the sphere policy but also the worrying that of their alternatively of their inconsistency
must [reflexionarse] on this ambivalence for [superarla]
the truth is that the lines the with of the battle democratic currently is have [desplazado] and that in many cases the soldiers republican already not progress in the good sense
not [saldremos] gaining if we a foundations of referenda national organised in role of the needs and of way [desordenada]
a signing in white the [monarca] european at or a high the vacuum the hole [nacionalista] is what options for the citizen
not not we from fashioned of effect but a exercise common of plenary right relaxed and essentially of the options and the democracy this time to scale european
not there crisis in greece italy spain portugal of fact not [sabríamos] where end the list because only there a crisis the crisis of europe
the whole of europe is the that is [pliega] to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of rating that the that unaccompanied their powerlessness and their lack of solidarity
is the whole of europe the that suffering a humiliation in the sphere international
we into for the transfer of sovereignty to europe but is whole europe the that lose slowly the sovereignty and with she every a of their nations
what more urgent is that the sovereignty popular ’ the helm the project european
because only together will the european reduce the weight of their debts shake of the markets and preparation their future by the investment
the exit of the crisis multi decisions to scale european that not will factored without a legitimacy democratic total unless that be for [conducirnos] the disaster
after have fought for a time against this proposal of the socialists and of jacques delors all the world calls in the today a governance economic european
that so be
but think in she without a greater integration policy and democratic and without that be [vivida] as such for the citizens would a new madness and we would to a new point died
we in a new stage of the construction european
for build the republic in france was be apos to apos republican
the revolution motivated for interests not would enough
this lesson still being applies
we build a europe more integrated since the point of view economic
only is will achieve build a europe more democratic in the level political a real sovereignty popular european
for build europe us european
