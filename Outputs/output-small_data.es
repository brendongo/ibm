survey so to 900 children 
the survey is was to end the last year school and took in the same almost 900 children of education basic of all liberec . 
already was the second issue the programme of &quot; the obesity of not is a casualidad &quot; , that supports the company of sure health general and the company unilever . 
to now , have participated in the project more of 12 billion children since the 4º to the 8º course . 
a dieta appropriate and quite exercise in family are factors determinantes , that do reduce a the number of children with obesity and even obesity . 
&quot; only the half of the children encuestados have would that have five house like according the regime : understand , lunch , food , merienda and dinner , that is a of the conditions in for a dieta healthy &quot; , other one of the results of the survey . 
without understand but with embutido for dinner 
the specialists avisan of that , in a development healthy , are important , also , the details , that also have , as for example have a time set for the understand in family . 
in liberec , not however , only the 23 % of the families of schoolchildren desayunan to the same time . 
in the majority of the families , every one desayuna only . 
but what worst was be that in the 10 % of the who not is desayuna nothing . 
the understand is , without however , the basis of a dieta day right . 
the study shows that in the families of children overweight is that with very more often the insanas potatoes fritas . 
almost all - regardless the weight - they to daily refrescos dulces ( 70 % ) . 
for rule general do sport more the 40 % of the children encuestados , without however , establish their parents this result is reduces to least of the half , only the 15 % .

&quot; the preferences food of the children czech in age categories between the 12 and 15 years , since the point of view of a food healthy , are very from of what ideal . &quot; 
between their food favourite is are the pasta , the meat and the dulces 
&quot; is on all alarming the popularity of the refrescos dulces &quot; , is by in the report end the study . 
as food main is for the la the pasta and you still of close the meat of historic . 
virtually , the children reject always the legumbre and the will for the fish and the i is very under . 
change to habits made 
the same time , the study shows that the children are prepared to change their habits food if they the information fair . 
&quot; in the group of control of the participants in the study , that rellenaron the cuestionario after of end the programme of prevention &quot; the obesity not is a casualidad &quot; , is was in many cases a change important to favour of the principles of a food healthy &quot; , is as in the results the study . 
out the attention , for example , what main to the refrescos dulces , where many children empezarían to preferir the water normal and aware . 
the children also elegirían with more often in the cuestionario the meat of historic and the fish for the food main and restringirían the consumption of food fresh and the derivatives of harina . 
the estilista has of be also a good currently , people the professionals 
in the article introductorio , how about the estilistas , already i quejé a little of that the lessons initial already were quite cargadas . 
not had or idea of how would what . 
conferences of three professionals the ramo , how certain to resolute problem and , also , a seminar on how works in the world the spectacle . 
and will worst . 
as more close are the examinations end , more information and tasks practices we aguardan 
and although the course is develops every saturday and sunday , already not is a alfiler . 
we time we examined with the director , alena , ( in the course not there no man ) on how certain to the woman that not has a simetría perfect . 
and so is the great majority . 
someone is cuellicorto , someone has a on estilizada without the curvas right and someone suffering obesity . 
the estilista has of know try ópticamente a shoulders anchos , alargar a bottleneck or recrear the curvas necessary 
we have given certain noticed on how to i the body of women the kind of jennifer valverde , of pechos and caderas enormous but cintura close and the same time not vestirla of a way too desafiante 
if , for example , the difference between the cintura and the caderas is so that the single or the trousers not is adaptan , is the it done coser the least a paper of russians extra to measure . 
without doubt not is arrepentirán , because the clothes that where perfectly is impagable . 
with a single to measure is cannot a better that with a that not for of get , levantarse , baila in the cintura , etc. 
the body estilizado is can allow certain clothes with pliegues , adornos , bordados or drapeados . 
there certainly many types of information various and of bodies , so that i back of that have of all the week for to order in my head all this information . 
and even so , i fear that with the task asignada , already i more that of well . 
to every a in the course is you have allocated two famous , to the that must would two vestuarios : one for the day and another for the night . 
there that have in account the aspect current , the lifestyle of fashionable that is adecue to the person in question . 
i has tocado &quot; certain &quot; to miranda kerr , perhaps the conozcáis of the campaign of victory &apos; s secret . 
out for within , for me is a better that , for example , britney spears or christina aguilera , that recently will engordado a hundred kilo ( for favour , have in account the certainly ) , or the jovencísima selena gómez . 
the guantanamo we that recortarlos of the weeklies or buscarlos in internet and imprimirlos , for after elaborarlos illustrating . 
the moodboard , that is as is out the result completely , this also our lifestyle personal and our relationship with the design gráfico . 
is important also think in the part gráfica the estilismo . 
the estilista , for therefore , not viste only physically , but that also is as , for example , of the pages of products in the weeklies ( of subjects specific , as trends , bolsos , huge , etc. ) . 
of all this we spoke the estilista and designer mario kameník . 
but all this already is for the sunday . 
the estilista has of have a vision global . 
the three invited specialists provided the conference the saturday with information on all kind of bodies . 
the estilista honza pokorný , the designer of fashionable jakub polanka and the fotógrafo of fashionable ben renč . 
jakub we reminded that the fashionable is a illusion and the estilista should saberle from party to this . 
and a good estilista know work with a same prenda of certain of forms various . 
the variabilidad is , in this case , fundamental . 
so , the such gabardina ( or as say in english , trench-coat ) is can certain to what classic with vaqueros and camiseta , but also serves for certain the body naked with shoes of tacón and fotografiarlo as if it in reality a clothing . 
or well enough arremangarla and go the bottleneck for obtain a image completely different . 
&quot; jugad with this &quot; , we he . 
what that more valoro is the next council : &quot; for start to work , ago lack that first conozcáis all the rules &quot; . 
&quot; then already quot romperlas &quot; , said jakub . 
for end i is clear for what memorizamos all these keep , what is being with what , for what , if then is that in the weeklies of fashionable we are results different . 
that without about of the desfiles . 
thank the fotógrafo ben , i that a estilista has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the that to fotografiar . 
so , for a history of fashionable that have ten pages ( for therefore , ten outfits ) , there that have right , lists for use , the least fifteen . 
and also that the photos the clothes works in combination with other prendas , all them different to the that is fired in the reality . 
all this there that mind in account to the time of would the outfit . 
honza pokorný we was that the image and the lifestyle excessive them alone , in many cases , the half the success . 
enough look to madonna , that not is precisely a as extraordinary , but the image and the márquetin have fact of she a star world . 
in liberec , for the at , not there still a trend clear to use the services of the estilistas . 
to the resolute famous also what are pointless ( i be my skills , my aspect physical not has so importance ) . 
and when someone we pida our services , there that have in account that is very likely that we indiquen a enormous very different to the their real ( will ) . 
then only is guglear and affair if the weeklies the heart already have writing on the issue , if a certain celebridad has engordado / adelgazado , etc. 
the sunday , honza and mario we insistieron in that the estilista not you enough orientarse in the fashionable , but that has that understand of outfit . 
for their work , on all is must communicate with the people to the that viste , for what that is fundamental be a good currently . 
know appreciate to the people , not is ago of least , for their views . 
&quot; when a director you contrata for that you clasifiquéis the vestuario and is what completéis with prendas fine , not quot take and though all what that had and say : &quot; huy what horror &quot; &quot; . 
&quot; encontrad the least a couple of things that podáis ponderar and recommend for that someone is the can to &quot; , says mario . 
he same also we was that all must caber in the called &quot; placovka &quot; , is say , the exchange of work . 
this is set around of the cintura and is have there all the tools necessary . 
are items as nail , as nail , quitapelusas , or imperdibles . there also will of nailon ( that you serves the estilista for the session of photos of products such that bolsos or gorros ) , pinzas special of enganche of prendas for front , if this outside greater ( the alfileres and another kind of enganches not are permitidos , therefore could damage the fabric ) , or a game of remnant . 
for not slogans in the heard pasiva and to something in practice , we learned to revestir the suela of the shoes . 
even for the session of photos in the study , in a surface people , is could damage the suela and a more still the foreign . 
and not we more that revestir and revestir . 
not unexpected touch the shoes with the nail for not dañarlos for accident . 
so that had that be very hábil . 
mario i has given a joy the who my work without reserves . 
the truth is that not is i give very well these skills . 
this is only a small part of all the that we heard for all the end of week , in the second part the course . 
already i i given account that help the estilismo to level professional not is a way of tinted , but i does exactly as what that fairly the people . 
in need and speed : the run is need for all america . 
comment 
a journey , in principle despreocupado , is complicates to cause of a series of descuidos impropios of a journey routine for the time of morning . 
in certain measure is managed cover the expectations , but this not serves of nothing , if , in reality , not is intended to nothing so . 
the new over , to the that the title is adds the run , when large expectations already before of their estreno . 
prometía that would new buenos to the former saga of to need and speed and , to as of what shown , is as a game that not should end being other time a gender of action without more . 
also we we curiosos for know how no the scenes insertadas , where the apos main share the car and walking for their own ordinary . 
as is happen in the series of nfs , the results not an great thing on to what that we been . 
there to that is can give for volumes , but in the cómputo total is some points to cause of failures absurd , that already come apareciendo in the series since ago years . 
in reality not is can or question errors , but that is is more well of the desgana incomprehensible of the programadores . 
the adventure it very well . 
is you kind in a history , whose leading , as , has certain problems personal ; for resolverlos , is you offers participate in a career illegal for all america . 
you sentáis the volante in the at west , in st which , and tardiness mission is come the first to new york . 
the idea is offer something interesting . 
the route is into in ten stages and , then , in more of fifty to . 
of this is follows that every career has place for a route different and the stages are localizadas in different ’ , that are quite various and interesting . 
of that way , one not has or remotamente the that of that the game will always what same . 
some of the ’ are even agradables to the view , although the level technical the gráfico is equivalent the of evidence previous of the series . 
for therefore , not is nothing the another world . 
but the own for the desert , the landscape otoñal or the highest mountains covered of snow are a effect about very way . 
also , the to is diversifican of time in when for a element atípico . 
so , for example , in the desert you encontráis a storm of bit that human the visibility . 
in change , in the mountains there that have care for that not you sepulte a avalancha . 
according that , every a of the to is very well developed . 
only there a couple of models , but with that enough . 
for a at , intentáis adelantar to a amount of rival exigida ( what normal in a career classical ) , after tratáis of win time ( resolved classic cronometrado ) and then you expected a resolved against a only adversario . 
in a of all this is to sometimes the police , that not ago but obstruct still more the things . 
the element are the landscape outside the car . 
is have animaciones interactivas when as , in the majority of the cases , has of escape of someone and you you that ayudarlo , always pulsando the botón fair in the at fair . 
nothing complicated . 
is surprising , without however , that has enough least landscape in the game of what that be wait ( in particular there only three ) . 
but the result end is positive , because this element not is to be means and , in the context already mentioned , is one of the elements that do that the game it more interesting . 
the model of influence still the fingerprinting of the episodes previous . 
that to say that to day of today already not be great thing , but not is can say that be bad . 
if buscáis a simulación realistic , already quot to in other part . 
but to a career bound with quite action you be quite this lifestyle of influence , although we find something better between the games of the competition . 
to here , all in order . 
but the problems arise after of a true time . 
to difference of what right of the models of influence , already not happens what same with the just . 
of games of this kind not is wait that recree deformaciones and just complicated , but of fact before of a coup against any subject , not quot predict how reaccionará vuestro cars , with what which not all is in order . 
is typical that , the to a adelantamiento very ajustado or able the cars with a traffic normal , so only has covered roces , but in other situations almost identical , vuestro cars has doing piruetas descontroladas . 
or even has completely destroyed . 
thank the system of reseteo , not arise large problems , but can poneros of is humour . 
the reseteos are programados of such way that , when sufres a accident or you sales of the back , the game you restituye the last point of rescue in the back . 
without however , in every career only is at of five reseteos available . 
if the consumís all , you that restart the career since the principle . 
so therefore not is more that a aid in case of that something not will well , but not is very of fiar . 
to sometimes , or the reseteo aid , only aid the aprenderse the stage on of memory . 
a great disadvantage the game is that the ourselves facts is or in different places . 
in some curvas , for example , there that into of a way specific ; of another way , are being of take . 
other sometimes you encontráis in some get vehicles &quot; civil &quot; always with the same configuration , although estéis the first , quintos or lleguéis five minutes before or after . 
this ago of rabiar on all in situations , when veis that two autos that will the i in directions go , your contrincante adelanta without problems , but when llegáis , debéis girar or well direct . 
is as when lleguéis , because is thing for that the &quot; surprise &quot; always will front of force narices . 
the adversaries have also a advantage more . 
for all the starting llegaréis to websites where , without have in account the at , always you adelantará the same adversario in the same get . 
also this happens the end of the starting , in a long bridge , what which is still more chocante . 
vuestro oponente must come before that you , the price that be . 
when is front of you , you difficult the vision of the autos that come of with , so that the principle quot to papilla the car . 
is can understand the idea of create a game with maximum takes of suspense and adrenalina , but the execution is so apparent that surely you decepcione hearing . 
and is a it , because although the model the journey be simple , the game is fun and with action , of way that to often not is possible to the detail what that is or where . 
and really does as , if the merit is for the idea with fifty runs unique or the classification in the career for that not quepa the platitude , or any other thing . 
a idea inhabitual is the change of autos for the to . 
you that be stress to the surtidores of petrol the on of the road , because exactly there you that change of cars , although in the great majority of the cases you suffice what that you . 
the autos is into in three categories . 
the sports are suitable for areas urban , the autos strong american for the motorways rectas and the exóticos superdeportivos for a influence technical , for example , for roads of mountain with curvas . 
also will narrativo main also is a will of challenges parallel , is say , there to in places specific that conoceréis for the stories . 
here conseguiréis not only wish , but also points of experience for vuestro profile , that serves therefore for the challenges as the cuentos . 
the achieve the level higher , the driver is you open several for , beginning for the cars and acabando with funds for the profile . 
the same time , there conectada a role autolog in line , that compared vuestros results with the of other players and disponibiliza other duties community . 
one of the elements more difficult of understand is how is made the last career in the history . 
with the car llegáis to the tunnel the metre ( just ) , where you ponéis to is to among for the to ( just ) . 
the velocímetro you mark between 150 and 200 km / h ( just ) and , of suddenly , for behind you is the convoy the metre and is you for for front without more . 
in the significant surely we a discussion on this for several days , on if for the programming the game none was even a little or if the authors of truth we take for a may of bobos . 
the part technical the game not is nothing so , but the least the effects visuales general are in the majority of the cases agradables , to sometimes to soberbios . 
therefore what it that , in the at more tensos is reduces the quality of image and , in times , of a way serious . 
this affects on all to the accidents where there involucrados many participants , when the quality of image continual already not is reasons . 
the audio is well and the such sonora is a question of draw . 
to end of that be the welcome to the greater part the group youth , the such sonora belongs to the category &quot; every one of their father and of their mother &quot; , but is can mean that one ending the game only for their music . 
the that end of need and speed : the run is therefore quite confused . 
if the game evitase errors absolutely his , we we problems in say that the run is the better game of nfs of the last years . 
does the that of that the game not is concluded . 
the diversión is asegurada , but preparaos because the errors you back in the eyes with the force of a reflectores of airport .

the new since of representative of the policy foreign and security is explains to from of the question : &quot; do who is this eu ? do to what number i llamarla ? &quot; . is is therefore of a step important towards the unification and the clarification of of the union policy of face to states as china or india . 
one to prohibirnos the cheese of olomouc 
vicenová is has occupied also of the agenda was , still and will the council european in the future next . 
the presidency czech of ago two years was a success . 
the czech is raised of the crisis economic regarded , they the crisis the gas and they a summit for the partnership eastern . 
the fall the government in at at is lighthouse as a aspect very negative , that back seriously to liberec . 
the representation czech in the eu has for the at many commitments . 
in words of the her : &quot; a good mighty &quot; , not only the presidency , but also the crisis financial , that is is trying now . 
for another on , there that approve the budget for seven years of the eu , caused for the current situation economic , a more one . 
if the budget is more simple and effective , do what sectors will priority , what countries will greater support and what least ? that is something that will present in the agenda of the next meeting . 
the her reminded also their lemas main , with the that was to europe : &quot; about of europe with clarity &quot; . 
&quot; what true is that not i them the abreviaciones feas , the extranjerismos or the jergas that the people not understand &quot; . 
&quot; do how can a citizen understand that in brussels not is busy of truth the curvature the curvature curvos or redondos , bananas of various sizes or that one we is to ban the cheese of olomouc ? &quot; . 
also to from more from the environment of the eu and closer to more citizens czech to the institutions european . 
we expected the europe of the multi 
according the her , the czech have reputation of eurosceptics and the people is more well the aspects negative that the positive . 
also , lamentó the low participation of the czech in the institutions european . 
the fault is of a of factors , as the modestia of our candidates , their inability for write messages of motivation , but also the little support of the czech . 
also the success of the presidency czech , it of highlighted the force and the cooperation the group of visegrad . 
&quot; créanme that when who to me a polish and a hungarian and is i about a who , a french to my on i says : &quot; do what , already you been , the the group of visegrad ? &quot; , and is is that not you ago no grace &quot; . 
in the future , to the eu , according vicenová , you aguardan new regulations durísimas of policy budgetary for the states member . 
is is as something very real the concept of the two multi , if not are more , in europe , more that the new of &quot; the federation european &quot; . 
&quot; we countries in the eurozona and countries outside of the eurozona &quot; . 
&quot; we the space schengen and we also the procedure of cooperation from &quot; . 
&quot; is said for first time that only cooperen the countries that want and the that not , that is make outside &quot; . 
&quot; these procedures will every time more and will the europe of the two multi &quot; , is expected vicenová . 
in this sense , also skills the role of liberec and of herman will van in the implementation the principle , according the which all the subjects that affect to the entire of the eu is must discuss between the states member , not only between the member of the eurozona .

the same sofisticación to long term the maintained ibm in the relationship with the client . 
already since the principle the company it be talentos ( the be a of the first companies world in end with any kind of discrimination , could choose without problems ) . 
in the line of the strategy tackle is the plan current of ibm , for the that to palmisano what sustituirá the year that next a woman : the rometty .

a institution with good ensure 
the position set in the business being to the company a image internal and external strong .

&quot; ibm not is a company technological , but a company that is resolve problems of business for users of the technology &quot; , puntualiza orwell colony of the consultora shape research . 
as the own company says there a difference between into in the business and create directly a business . 
ibm - or the &quot; great green &quot; - as is the known in the ee.uu. familiarmente to cause of their logo , is has become in the last hundred years in a of the are companies the world . 
is possibly the company technological more versátil ( develops therefore equipment as programmes , infrastructure and services it website within of a wider range of services , that will since his to nanotecnología ) .

for that , ibm not has problems in build their foundations in other platforms ( and also , if not work , the or ) . 
and this the difference of the competition , microsoft , that all is maintained and you always exclusively with then . 
technology of future 
in question of sales , ibm is he on all to services , of the that approximately a fifth part are of programmes and other fifth of equipment . 
with all , still in 1990 the equipment represented more of the half of the share of the suppliers .

&quot; but here would not already as my wanted and old borrico that is equivocó , but as a man the that i between certain links &quot; , said rychtářová and but that already is had desenganchado of their husband and insisted only in the respect mutual .

&quot; not dormimos together and she not i interested , or where is or if has some novio . 
already i that is fault my , i enamoré of iveta and authority all the responsibility &quot; , concluded josef . 
the worst disadvantaged of the women : do also is refer to you ? 
if pedís to the men that are able of quote some disadvantaged classic of the women , in general every one of them the nombrará without think . 
dear women , do you reconocéis in the lines following , where is citan certain disadvantaged femeninos that obtaining to hervir the blood to the consists ? 
go of purchases 
do you reprocha to their average orange that has on of the purchases ? 
do has that afford for what least a trapito in week ? 
do you like buy to often in the on ? 
then in their case is can say that go of purchases is has become in a vice . 
some women is give account that should appease their pasión for the purchases , for what least a little . 
but to see , do what woman could resistir the temptation of wander without more for the shops of clothes , to prendas well ajustadas and after probárselas all in the probador ( idealmente in all colours different ) ? 
although for the majority of the women go of purchases is a willingness , for the men can become virtually in a hell . 
only me how sometimes already you has said to their couple that better the espere front of the door . 
the dissatisfaction constant 
&quot; do not i too blind ? &quot; 
&quot; emphasized adelgazar for what least five kilo - do should start to to exercise ? &quot; 
&quot; do of truth you will ? &quot; 
do not you sound these sentences ? 
do to that yes ? 
then is a of these women obsesionadas for their aspect . 
not is that you should to of cuidarse , but many men are alérgicos to listen to their couple quejarse all the time of their aspect physical . 
the sex strong also is of agreement in that as more is the often of the complaints , more molestas is them the women . 
the order and the up in first place 
is as a tiovivo infinito . 
must the windows , to the aspiradora , fregar the soil , validity the dust , fregar the bath and all that for what least two sometimes for week . 
do you reprocha to their couple that you has pisado the soil fair with a ordinary dirty , to their children that have fewer a lavabo new rolls and a estantería with doors of glass that therefore you cost must ? 
in case of that you sufra this &quot; handicap &quot; , pruebe to be aware of that nothing is should refusal and that the order and the up surely not should should be primordiales in the family . 
this i inofensivo of up could amenazar their relations and the welfare family . 
to comments unpleasant 
&quot; the calzoncillos category is up with the clothes laundry . &quot; 
&quot; your ponerte also morning these calcetines category &quot; 
&quot; is the trapo were not is is in the soil ! &quot; 
if ago these cometarios to their couple more sometimes the day , will that so will take of their particularly . 
course . you not to say nothing bad , only to get that all is in order . 
such time , if the men supiesen this , the women , for their part , not would many comments . 
calumnias and chismes 
to some women them will also the calumnias , the chismes , but also the ofensas and the conspiración against someone . 
the women is concentran in the relations , for that them like about money of things the kind who , where , with who , how and for what . 
to what better to every a of past to sometimes is you escapa a small and inofensivo chisme . 
with the hand in the heart , this is own of almost all the women . 
for another on , there women chismosas of these that not is monitored , to the that them love chismorrear and what do to often , desprecian to all and are dangerous for the that the around , on all in a team labour female . 
jágr and voráček ayudaron with their asistencias to through the philadelphia 
the delantero of hockey jaromír jágr took the monday in the i of nhl with two asistencias that trajeron the victory on the philadelphia 5 : 3 in the cancha of carolina and again to to to the players czech in the forefront of the competition . 
in both cases claude giroux only the going of the star of ratio years , and was a step more and was of better player the party . 
is adjudicó two asistencias in the party and also the about of jágr , jakub voráček . 
after the i , jágr stated to the journalists of overseas that giroux had rate a great night . 
&quot; already before the party you had said that would triplete &quot; . 
&quot; what presentía &quot; . 
&quot; to sometimes seem emboscadas &quot; , he jágr , after of that their action you diese a gol to giroux , to as the first trallazo the flyers . 
a just after also the second intervention the team had a trace czech . 
voráček is was with the disco for behind of the portería of the hurricanes and what movió between the circles to maxim talbot , that metió gol . 
a second before of the first pause a player local , further dwyer , was expulsado , but since the principle of the second part already dominaron the flyers . 
particular for giroux . 
after we with jágr metió the third gol , after of that their disparo is colase for the fourth of the portería of wayne simmonds . 
&quot; i love play with he &quot; . 
&quot; not i say that be the better player of the cancha , but without doubt is between the three best &quot; , ponderó jágr to their central . 
&quot; never is i would happened that the end of my career was to play with a deportista as he &quot; . 
&quot; i very pleased of this &quot; . 
&quot; i play for he &quot; . 
all these years in the nhl , my colleagues jugaban for me , and that now is results &quot; , adds jágr . 
carolina still became the party in a since , with the gol of tuom ruutu and then of new of dwyer , of penalti , to only to a gol of distance . 
matt read not allowed more complications , although ended overcome in number of two against one . 
&quot; pronger had a good action in our field &quot; . 
&quot; despejó the disco , i i speed and read is was towards the part more alejada &quot; . 
&quot; traté of atinarle the disco and i all because what up &quot; , describía voráček the last gol the party such as what lived . 
with their victory , philadelphia is has since in head of the conference this . 
the ombudsman czech the montreal , jaroslav Špaček , not just to the end the party against buffalo , in the second third is from for a had in the part higher the body . 
the canadiens not only lost a player with very experience in defence , but also for a difference of two goals , 2 : 3 . 
tomáš plekanec not it take one of the basis . 
more that the points recovered the you local lamentó the great amount of lesionados in the last class , and play the party only with five have . 
&quot; that is bad &quot; . 
&quot; itself the party only with a player off , the rest were noveles &quot; . 
&quot; in end , but is that against that not is can to nothing , we that lidiar with this &quot; , said jacques martin . 
&quot; therefore rotar to the players is came against us , not what we resistir &quot; . 
&quot; had that simplify more still the game , from the disco of our field &quot; . 
&quot; and so there of &quot; , he one of the have , p. k. subban . 
the portero ondřej pavelec within with thirty speeches the winnipeg in the victory of 5 : 2 on the tampa bay . 
the goals of jets were aggressive for five players that put so end to a series of derrotas that already duraban five parties . 
how have out the prices of the travel since 1989 
to 1989 had in the czechoslovakia of then only five agencies of travel state you : Čedok , sporturist , ckm , rekrea and autoturist . 
the agencies of travel of at at vendían in the majority of the cases travel only the bloc socialist , therefore the travel to west were very restringidos . 
the tourists czech would , for therefore , of holiday to the beaches of the case ( republic democratic german ) , to the union soviet , ( sochi in crimea in the sea black ) to bulgaria and romania ( both in the sea black ) and to hungary ( balaton ) . 
a exception positive was the period for between 1962 and had , when is could travel to yugoslavia , without however , after the regime yugoslavo is inclinó towards the west and the travel of the tourists czech were then quite restringidos . 
a great paradoxically the socialism was the fact that to the citizens the bloc socialist ( or be , also to the checoeslovacos ) not is them permitiese travel free and individually or even for the countries socialists . 
if a citizen wanted travel individually , for example , to poland or to the union soviet , needed a letter of invitation , if not , the journey individual not was possible . 
the agencies of journey ofrecían in those times also travel the west , but one is should to to the eu with a together of our and to so all the night , or have &quot; good known &quot; in the agency . 
still so not all was cattle . 
the called &quot; promise of change &quot; that was the condition for the travel the west , not is concedía to the &quot; people politically little reliable &quot; , that so not could travel in at . 
the currency checoslovaca not was a currency freely all and , without guarantee of change , not was possible obtain the resources ( the currency western ) for travel to west . 
the great majority of the czech experience their holiday in their own country , for what that had a great number of bonemeal and houses of summer , that the czech adquirían . this in still there . 
the way of travel of the czech has suffered since 1989 a real revolution . 
while that to 1989 for us was the not is more to the holiday in the case or bulgaria , the year last the czech did 4,5 million of travel of holiday to countries of all the world . 
is nna great paradoxically , of the that today day already not we aware , the fact of that the destination currently favourite , croatia , to 1989 not is could travel freely , because was part of the yugoslavia of then . 
to principles of the years 90 is imposed the exemption of visa for travel to the states neighbours of europe western , what that resulted a wave huge of visits of short term , sobretodo to vienna or germany . 
the checoeslovacos , for a time , not is his hartos of the excursiones the west , all the world wanted it the what least for a at . 
for example , in paris dormían the groups of czech in the parks in shops of campaign , already that our income of then not we permitían pay a hotel or pension . 
a feature typical of the czech of at time was the be for the food ( canned , pieces , etc. ) for save . 
another at important was the introduction of the convertibilidad of the percent czech , so our tourists could finally , after of decades , buy freely currency western . 
our level of life aumentaba and with he also the wages media , what that around of 1997 resulted a increase in the demand of travel . 
with the increase of the demand of travel they the agencies , to from of 1997 with regularly , to preparing the travel using the colleges of flights chárter , what that was down incredibly the prices of the travel in compared with the last , thank to the possibility of obtain check for the volume of passengers . 
to end of the 90 the century last , already the czech long without visa to almost all the countries developed , are ee.uu. , what which simplificó still more our travel . 
another at interesting in the history the tourism pos-revolucionario happened already in the 2000 , when was organised , thank to a huge demand , the first flight direct since liberec to a country exótico , and was to thailand . 
since at year , proceed all the years flights chárter direct with tourists czech was countries distant and calurosos . this winter already is volará directly since liberec to 12 destinations exóticos . 
the countries exóticos the their currently close of 100 billion czech the year . 
another at interesting of this time , that symbolises our development pos-revolucionario , was in the year 2008 . 
the 17 of november of 2008 , ee.uu. squeezed the visa for the tourists czech , with what that our country happened to be between the countries more developed the world . 
in 2008 the czech , for first time in their history , have last more of the half of their holiday in the abroad ( 50,3 % ) and for first time in their history , is have above in travel the abroad more of 15 billion billion czech for head , including the expenditure in the get of they . 
shot house general ordinary for choose the president , that could end of new in point died . 
since ago almost five months the football czech is without president and is likely that the successor of safronov hašek as president of the federation czech of futbol ( faČr ) , not is conocerá or after the call of the next house general extraordinary that will place this thursday in nymburk . 
of fact , still not is has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to to . 
without the same , not is will vote even for choose between the three candidates . 
the interested to presidir the football czech are jindřich rajchl , miroslav pelta and tomáš paclík . 
hašek renunció to their office in june not without before rectify to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that supiese means the football in the future . 
without however , after of by the was hašek , is used a controversy between the two federaciones of the partnership unable of come to a agreement for are a candidate common . 
this became in obvious the 16 of september when had that be elected the new president . 
the delegates of the house general is met in vain in the home national ( národní dům ) , on in the area praguense of smíchov , because the discussions is had blocked and not only in as the method of election . 
not is was to no consensus or in as to who in the house general had right to vote - only the representatives legal or also the delegates with a powers . 
to from of that at and because to this only point , is in a agreement part , supported also for the recommendation the institute of state and right , according the which the representation for a powers not is possible . 
without however , the disputes on the code electoral are open . 
more light on the situation already not could should or the committee executive that , in their meetings , ordinarias or extraordinary , all not within nothing . 
the opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of sometimes already , but the point nerve still being the same . 
the question is the next : do of what way proceed in the third round for avoid the point died ? 
&quot; the dispute revolves in about to if is must proceed of agreement with the estatutos or find another model &quot; , says dušan svoboda , one of the three vicepresidentes of the faČr , that , since the direction of the partnership , represents the futbol professional . 
according the model proposed in the estatutos , in the third round point at candidate that have greater percentage of support in the federation to the which will their candidacy . 
the region of caused is ready to come to a compromise for that can win at candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both federaciones . 
the part bohemia , without however , which the condition of that the winner , according these are porcentuales , should have the majority of the least two thirds . 
&quot; this you quitaría , without however , the sense to the two rounds previous and negaría for completely the concept of system bicameral &quot; , so is as svoboda understand the concerns of the part morava , according what which what better would not touch the order and vote according the estatutos files . 
with what said , before , is of agreement also tomaš paclík , although is is that the regulation electoral established for the estatutos of all the candidates be more to pelta . 
&quot; i like that is votara the maximum of agreement with the estatutos &quot; . 
&quot; for that not is inventen no tontería about of the representatives as in the last house general &quot; , says the you of victory plzen , that is postula for first time as candidate and that at their comments mainly in against of pelta . 
pelta still being set . 
according he , in nymburk is decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future cooperaran of way constructive . 
&quot; all the pasiones is apaciguarán with the party of today of our team national in the championship european . 
&quot; the football will to be leading , and so is cooperara more to will &quot; says the representative the jablonice , that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football , therefore to level professional as regional . 
rajchl is the more reticent . 
&quot; i that is it to a agreement , but , for unfortunately , the situation is a more one . &quot; 
&quot; not is is the conflict between bohemios and moravos , but there especially of ajustar the rules to their own convenience . &quot; 
&quot; this can have as result a new deadlock of the house general . &quot; 
&quot; of all any , i that is band the sense common &quot; , said rajchl . 
already not is a time for that all the parties are to a agreement . 
some negotiations had that take in montenegro , but do who can know to that start the party if the team of football will completely ? 
the air special , in the that had that travel to podgorica , between other the vicepresidentes dalibor kucera and rajchl , not has out this morning for problems technical in prague , taking that other a alternative for carry to part the committee executive the place where will place the party of classification . 
quizas the meeting decisive , for end , could be the that will place to level ministerial , that , according have , is will this wednesday . 
to josef dobeš , minister of education , youth and sports , you like a aspect to the parties divided to the organisation integrating more powerful the country for that is it to a agreement . 
there a in game : the benefits state , the credibility the football and also the next house general the committee central of the federation checoslovaca the sport ( Čstv ) that increase made of a new direction the sport czech after the problems financial of the home of loterías sazka . 
paclík luchará for achieve the presidency , because not is a candidate more appropriate . 
if the head of the futbolistas of pilsen , tomaš paclik , before of the house general extraordinary conociera the name of a candidate appropriate that satisficiese all their ideas on the new president of the federation czech of football ( faČr ) , or is would as candidate to a since so relevant . 
&quot; if would a person appropriate , would fighting for she and not i would as candidate to the elections . &quot; 
&quot; but to the day of today not is has been find a person so &quot; , said paclík for the agency of news czech ( Čtk ) 
what that way to paclík to into in the challenge with miroslav pelta and henry rajchl is exactly the possibility of say to pelta , the course winner of the elections , that opens the way to the presidency of the federation czech of futbol ( faČr ) . 
paclík also puntualiza that , in case through , permanecería in the office of president only to 2013 , when would the time of the house general ordinary . 
in that office you like see to a expert and good terms that not is too related with the events seats . 
&quot; already i about with some people to the that could have in account &quot; . 
&quot; for me was a madness hear to some say that in this at or even want identify with the football czech . &quot; 
&quot; i like change that vision &quot; , adds . 
what that supposed more bother to paclík in this at is the relationship of pelta with the president of the partnership of football regional of pilsen s berbr , a man with a last controversial , known outside the mundillo as a poderoso lobista with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in the house general . 
for paclík is so unacceptable see to pelta at in the sillón presidential . 
&quot; in case of that gane , is when the status existing and nothing in the football will &quot; . 
&quot; with the support of berbra , a man of business ambitious , the football rather still least from &quot; , said paclík . 
mentions also the fact of that ago a years the name of pelta was related with a heard telephone for the research of a case of corruption , of the which pelta went impune . 
&quot; not i what prestige the football could bring the victory of pelta . &quot; 
&quot; and with what eyes we plead the uefa and the fifa &quot; , said paclík , that also decision with certain caution their declaration previous that &quot; vendería the club pilsen if pelta is become in president &quot; . 
in the case of win the elections the thursday , paclík could be the cooperation with pelta in the future . 
of same opinion is the another candidate , rajchl , that has been supported for paclík before of the house general of september that end in a fiasco . 
&quot; he ( pelta ) would the first the that because &quot; . 
&quot; is very capable . &quot; 
&quot; i what could imagine , for example , as head of the representation &quot; . 
&quot; but not as terms of a partnership &quot; . 
&quot; i not meto the narices there where not i i capable &quot; , added paclík , that in september suscitó very attention for support the from of the commission of Árbitros presidida for ludek macel , potential after for dagmar damkova . 
paclík which that is atrevería to home the partnership . 
for to their capacities of management of the companies private , therefore since the summer last is also the director the pilsen , that with their support took in may the triunfo in first division . 
&quot; i force for change some things in the area of football and make to their practice safe . &quot; 
&quot; for reduce the influence of some groups of pressure , that probably tend to influence in the decisions the committee being and of appeal , have situations unpleasant , said paclík without so their antipatías towards the president the sparta daniel křetínský . 
a of the priorities also would the of s the relationship between the faČr and the committee olímpico czech , with the aid the which ejercía pressure on the leaders political for that into more money the sport of the tax of the i . 
&quot; is one of the problems key the that is should for the new president . &quot; 
&quot; if aumentaran the tax on the games of gambling , as what anuncian the parties political , would their arguments , but , frankly , have that tell where is to stop all this money &quot; , out . 
ademas , paclík now not has in account even their partnership with the club pilsner , although he same says that the president of the faČr must be &quot; not she &quot; . 
pelta is to their time related with jablonec and rajchl with dukla of prague . 
&quot; not is ideal . &quot; 
&quot; but not i sense the fact of yield claim my actions the club of pilsen to other person for then again there after a year and a &quot; , said paclík . 
pelta promised to the faČr new estatutos that acabarían with the point died of the elections . 
two days before of the house general of the partnership of football one of the candidates to the presidency , miroslav pelt , promised that , in case of be elected , they that the faČr had a new estatutos that sirvieran definitely for as , in the future , the controversy in as the regulation electoral . 
the representative the jablonec is set in as to the meeting of this thursday in nymburk , and believes that the conflict preelectoral could move towards a solution today with the possible victory the team of football . 
already before of the elections not made in september , pelta promised deal , in case of be elected , precisely in the representation and in certain funds . 
decided participate in the last minute in the last house general , for what that this itself of two months you could go well for defend and it , in a context more broader , their ideas on the management the football . 
&quot; the people of all the levels is as the football already ago a time and expected know this thursday the new president . &quot; 
&quot; feel that has come the time of that someone gestione the partnership &quot; , of the man that is couples mainly with the club of jablonice , but that worked in the sparta and in the committee executive of the partnership . 
for this reason , believes have enough experience for home the football czech . 
is convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that atmosphere in the time of safronov hašek . 
&quot; unfortunately , in the house general of june were adopted the estatutos that not were so them as all over . &quot; 
&quot; if excluimos certain interpretations , we a president already since september &quot; , would pelta . 
exactly the readaptación the document more important of the partnership sort is usó as señuelo for who to the delegates . 
&quot; if i eligen president , i what counts as a challenge personal and i prepared to respond in case of that this falle . &quot; 
&quot; is a question of principles , without the which not we there &quot; , says pelta . 
also , in theory , is not over with their opponents . 
already in the last had your that is was asylum with henry rajchl , the that respects for their training in right , being aware of that their oponente would also their first vice . 
already was a time without attack to he paclík who , the contrary of pelta , not he pawn with head . 
&quot; for more of a year in the world of football , and already has achieved some successes . &quot; 
&quot; their attacks but were vergonzosos and very people became amazed for the campaign electoral . &quot; 
&quot; for that many of them dudan on their real nature &quot; , said to their had pelta , that still being faithful to the statements good already in september . 
their weapon more powerful is , according he , their knowledge the football , since the apos more in to the with . 
this last should be escaparate of promotion the football . 
&quot; also , intentaría as all the escándalos that from to cause of the bohemians as result the scandal of corruption the year last . &quot; 
&quot; immediately after i involucraría in the negotiations with the sector public and the private , for ensure that has enough money for all the football &quot; , said ago two months to the Čtk the candidate of 46 years . 
to continuation also promised that their appointment as president the football not comportaría no change personal of the plantilla . 
&quot; would that know first the tasks of every he &quot; , said she to strahov where , after a long period of anarquía , has a nerviosismo agreed . 
to despite of the scenarios lack current that is vaticinan to the next house general , he believes that the delegates not travel in vain this thursday to nymburk . 
&quot; if the only point of disagreement will how vote in the third round , without doubt what we overcome . 
&quot; the football needs credibility , the which is will only if for end has a leader &quot; , still two days before of the apos more decisive in their career of representative , pelta still being set . 
rajchl promises , that under their leadership , the faČr empezaría to work with to . 
if in the quarter house general its elected the current vice jindrich rajchl as new president of the partnership of football czech , very people is and surely resentida . 
rajchl promises that , in case of be elected , is trabajaría hard . 
to implement a change systematic and to that the member the committee executive are responsible of every area the football individually . 
also is reducing to resolve the case of the bohemians , improve the relations with the uefa and the fifa , get more money for the football and continue with the work on for the previous president safronov hašek . 
&quot; as president , i like help for completely the football &quot; . 
&quot; since the contacts international with the uefa and the fifa to the selection , and for the football professional or the greater of young futbolistas of high performance . &quot; 
&quot; with this not i say that what would all only &quot; , said rajchl in a interview for the Čtk . 
&quot; i a player of team and i gentleman the competences the committee executive of such way that every member can who to a area corporate . &quot; 
&quot; and asignaré tasks difficult for that the football can , in every one of these segmentos , to forward with a momentum &quot; . 
&quot; to very people this probably not you gustará , because move start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the others &quot; , added . 
because to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement futbolístico , is says that has have the possibility of not stand of new as candidate . 
&quot; all know , that work 20 hours like . &quot; 
&quot; but need know that this will sense and that not will people behind of my that i – and obstaculizará to every step &quot; , he so the for of their indecisión . 
&quot; very people i has said that not i contacted for down , because then is give for vencidos also the others &quot; . 
&quot; is is of have faith for not leave so , without more &quot; , said . 
according say , you way also continue the work that already began with hašek . 
&quot; for these two years , is end a great part the work that not i that now is spring &quot; . 
&quot; there processes that is had started and that will their effect within of a couple of years and not i like that someone the pare &quot; , announced concerned for the fact of that , if eligieran the another candidate , miroslav pelta , the situation in the partnership could again to be such as was before of the time of hašek . 
&quot; i i in the order , and is something that , in my opinion , mirek pelta not is capable of keep . 
&quot; behind of he is on all all that people that is ocuparía the football for that outside only a privileged for a few elected . &quot; 
&quot; is i can reprochar a lot of things , but not the fact of that i to favour of someone . &quot; 
&quot; attempt be aim . &quot; 
&quot; i to a football for all , because only so is sentirán well all and not only the elected &quot; , said rajchl . 
this also the idea that only serious karlsbad the president . 
&quot; although some people seeking say what contrary , i in mind to what maximum for caused . &quot; 
&quot; for example , is time of think in the fact of gentleman the second division in a part czech and in other morava , whose winners irían to the first division &quot; . 
&quot; not is would the situation current in the that we only three equipment of caused , what that represents a problem for the players moravos young &quot; , said rajchl . 
although to the pugna of the elections presidential is sumó tomaš paclík , president the club pilsner , rajchl not is of believe in their for of be elected . 
&quot; still i have a strong support of the federation czech , the which i was as their vice and that know that behind of me there successes clear &quot; , said rajchl , whose successes understand the saving of a tens of million of billion of contracts desventajosos , the negotiations of contracts televisivos and the negotiations on the law of the i . 
for another on , recognised their part of fault in that the federation not is united . 
and while civilized that pelta is &quot; descalificado for to the confidence in the football czech &quot; , as the another relation , paclík , as a candidate strong that yes has something that offer the football . 
&quot; one can for that was a great work for the pilsen at year &quot; . 
&quot; in the case of that be elected , probably will what that already began safronov hašek and not cambiaria of way significantly the plantilla the personal in the committees . &quot; 
&quot; not i use that to my favour &quot; , evalúa so to their rival rajchl . 
the bath more fine of europe 
jump the blue 
for of stanek 
bath since a much incredible , temples bathing in budapest : who north europe can live their maravilla blue , and , after a visit to the city or a caminata , rest their piernas cansadas in bathing burbujeantes . 
a book shows where is is the better welfare in the water . 
when cable meder was a journey of research for the year and a last , had something that not could faltar in their luggage , a bañador . 
tumbada of back on the water , end the artistic cúpula in what high , nadaba towards the angelotes of mármol , that the would in the on of the apos and is asombraba to the apos mere modernista just meticulosamente . 
you horrible the bathing , whatever note in their libreta the at of all the details interesting on the lifestyle and the history the building . 
the historiadora arquitectónica meder exploró more of 200 bath of this way and the is in their recent book &quot; badefreuden &quot; : the bath covered in munich , the historical palaces the bathing in the jungle black , the &quot; instance of concrete &quot; in taunus . 
was their &quot; journey for the bathing more quot of centroeuropa &quot; for 13 countries : also of germany , austria and switzerland , visited places of italy , france , the republic czech , slovakia , slovenia , hungary , romania , poland , and a city respectively in luxembourg , serbia and croatia . 
this german of 46 years is a real supporter of the culture the bathing . 
not to have nothing that see with the sport , says meder , only the water is different . 
only you bother that the sports the bathing have that conformarse with azulejos blue and eu to medication , while that the sports to is can breathe the fascinating smell of the forests of abetos or listen the much trinos of the birds in the park . 
&quot; a day i asked for what the bath have that be always so feas &quot; , says this head of vienna . 
&quot; i to coleccionar bath fine . &quot; 
the surface the water greater the architecture . 
the chapoteo in the apos and the etéreos cheeses of the sauna . the factor of welfare in the bath is so large because is atienden all the ways , according meder . 
and if the from is intensive , the bath covered can be a real gift for the view : &quot; in place of soil , in the bathing is has a surface of water . &quot; 
&quot; for a part is transparent , for other part reflects the beauty of all the building . &quot; 
all is dobla ópticamente : the highest bóvedas , the azulejos of colours , the trampolines . 
the book with photographs in format small &quot; badefreuden &quot; being in 190 pages data very interesting on the architecture and the history the art in the oasis historical the welfare , but , mainly , does to of established the blue . 
meder , the coleccionista of bath which the copies leading in their research in hungary . 
together to the magníficos bathing medicinales as the bathing of széchenyi of budapest , of 100 years , is are the water with nitrates in a odd cavidad kárstica ( bathing in cavidades in miskolc-tapolca ) , so as a termas , whose bath are of water alcalinas and is are in a building with way of bottleneck ( városi termálfürdö in jászberény ) . 
many bath descubiertas in switzerland and austria offered these such : while all the city being the eyes in the apos techada of zurich , is can look to arlberb , mere of snow , since the apos foreign of a bathing in all . antón , and : in the bathing turkish there a window since the that is can we the practice in the runs of ski . 
the design , such time , more so expected to the customers in längenfeld : the cathedral the water of Ötztal seems a ovni that has of short in the alps . 
of three sources open they vapor in winter , while that of fund the mountains of Ötztal is their in the sky . 
alhambra in the jungle black 
to meder , the coleccionista of bath , not you invadía the smell to medication in all the bath . 
many bathing termales huelen to sulphur , in the bathing of Árpád in békescsaba , hungary , the fever to gasóleo is so strong that the people believes have come to a bathing health . 
the smell next of the water medicinales that contain bicarbonato and álcali and whose légamo is pega to the fur the into in the apos , a it the welfare of a way special . 
cable meder also is decepcionó in a place in their search of places bonitos for the bathing , when wanted visit bath descubiertas and bathing of sun in the bathing czech of luhatschowitz , is found with a ground blocked . 
the bathing of 1902 the within duan jurkovic was closed . 
when meder miró to through of the desmoronadas windows the building modernista red , white and hindu , was the like grow between the azulejos . 
the quickly contrarrestaba in a apos encantadora in the jungle black : the palacio spa in bad wildbald . 
these bathing have three phases of construction after of yes ; not only is can be elements neorománicos of times of their construction in 1844 , if not also a made arab of lifestyle alhambra , added in 1900 . 
since their esmerada investment in 1995 , the palacio spa is the bathing favourite of the coleccionista of bath , cable meder , and not only because be natural of the jungle black . 
&quot; has a merit fusionar different encourage arquitectónicos in a unit so fantastic &quot; , says meder . 
in a palacio so the inmersión in the apos spa apparently not has very importance .

the threat is concrete 
after the discovery of &quot; the just of zwickau &quot; , the media of communication turks dudan the state of right german . 
a newspaper about of a &quot; ideology bloody &quot; that again to reavivarse . 
the for of eight small employers noticed and greeks between the years 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right . 
in turkey and in the population german of origin turkish is has towards with fear and concern to this news . 
for many germans of origin turkish which a fantasma that is i died ago time , since the attacks with way of fires in mölln in november of 1992 and in solingen in may of 1993 , not had happened more episodes of violence with background of extreme right against turks . 
not however , never is has some that in germany there xenophobia . 
the network ultraderechista 600 reveals a scale whose dimensions not were , or a least , previsibles . 
&quot; do again to reavivarse the ideology bloody ? &quot; , titula the issue for internet the newspaper turkish &quot; haberturk &quot; . 
the newspaper &quot; sabah &quot; resalta for the contrary that one of the authors the crime was a – of the office federal of defence of the constitution and is shows concerned for that the authorities german can be involved in the pantanal ultraderechista . 
the community turkish in germany reaccionó with sensatez , the end of week reminded to the victims of the violence racist with a vigilia to the door of brandenburgo . 
two weeks before , the community turkish in berlin together with the political germans and turks reflexionaron in a act 3 the fifty anniversary the agreement turco-alemán . 
the them is it in scene with much colours , as a history with end happy . 
the information was to some media turks as a bofetada : &quot; the gift german for the fifty anniversary &quot; , says the title of a article in the platform turkish of internet &quot; have x &quot; , she the background of the chain of for . 
the emission german &quot; hürriyet &quot; not should in out this connection mental . 
&quot; beginning to eu is &quot; , says the title of the spine of ahmet külahci . 
resalta that the killed were people that pagaban their tax and did a important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of germany . 
in the body of internet of germans of procedencia turkish , the behaviour of the police and their and success in the búsquedas is is very criticism . 
the authors is asombran of that the authorities german not have buscado a before suspected in the leading of the ultraderecha . 
one is shows as least given in as to the drásticos media : &quot; to from of now here is lose , to the immigrants not them is more that the defence and the arms &quot; . 
&quot; this will the better autoprotección &quot; . 
&quot; the peace internal of germany on are of the quality of the perverse and of the finding of the penalty to all the network &quot; . , says &quot; selen &quot; . 
what that means that , if the peace internal of germany is in danger , the attacks of mölln and solingen is aclararán in nineties years . 
the image of the ruins the fire of solingen is has filmed in the bait german and turkish . 
no another and was more clearly to the turks that live here that there a threat concrete and , to the germans , that the mistrust and the distance can desembocar in the violence . 
the attacks agudizan the sense of group of the part turkish . 
not repeat the errors the last 
in the press turkish is criticism then mainly the uninhabitable of the policy german after the attacks , helmut kohl is denies to visit to the them of mölln . 
after the attack with way of fire of solingen sent a telegrama of condolences the president turkish and klaus kinkel , their minister of affairs foreign , what sustituyó in the funeral of cologne . kinkel detalló in their speech what that contribute with the tax the turks of germany . 
is clear how is estimated the value of a person according the amount of their tax . 
the information current of the media turks again to show what system that is , since then , the mistrust of many germans of origin turkish in the legality of this country . 
also the effort of a explanation wider and of a revaloración the terrorism of extreme right in germany , this time do lack words francas . 
the bank the scandal the amongst of zurich 
the bank more arriesgado of europe not is is in italy or france , if not in switzerland . 
the ubs almost she in bancarrota in the crisis financial and since then is deslizó of a crisis to the next . 
now the at a german . 
sure that axel about not what had thought . 
after of their witnessed starting of the summit the bank federal , in july is through that in 2013 comenzaría in a new and almost also of witnessed work : president the council administrative the great bank scheduled ubs , a inesperado and state step in their career . 
axel about is am should , considering switzerland for their beauty and to the ubs for their new acquired strength and is fall comments amables on their future colleagues . 
&quot; the bait has achieved a revival &quot; . 
&quot; i am we with kaspar villiger and oswald grübel &quot; . 
in september became clear that all would completely different . 
a for financial of the bait in london prevented all the systems of security the bank and defraudó 1,7 billion million of eur . 
oswald grübel , director general of the bait , a banker not only known in switzerland , had that come . 
the president the council administrative of the bait is was since then also tocado , and all a : do when is axel about ? 
is through that about must necessity the bank since february of 2012 . 
and is will office of the presidency the council administrative in may , not to principles of 2013 , as the bank comunicó the tuesday . 
this is hard for axel about . 
not is banker , more well , professor of economy and consejero and has had a period of adjustment surely necessary . 
of coup is ago responsible of the strategy of a bank , that has of again to prove that deserves the title &quot; the greater bank the scandal of europe &quot; since ago time . 
for a part , the bait is huge , to ago little was the greater administrator of goods world , and for other part , since ago years , is desliza of a scandal the next . 
nothing , so what seems , is you ahorra the changed so proud bank scheduled . 
started the crisis financial . 
the bait had a reputation excellent to 2007 . 
the image the administrator of goods scheduled discreto and sound , but also mañoso , is combinó with objectives ambitious , also wanted be a great number in the banks of investment . 
for a part , with 1,6 billion of dollars , the bait managed more money of customers wealthiest that any another bank the world . 
and for other part , avanzó as bank of investment in the league of the large banks the world . 
this impresiona . 
hans geiger , the former banker and and professor of banca in zurich for many years explains : &quot; to my students , always i described to the bait as model of a good bank . &quot; 
&quot; since the point of view current , one is question : do how could equivocarme ? &quot; 
was in a great mistake . 
in the year 2007 went to the light that something went very is in the bait . 
to mid of year , peter wuffli , director general , that to then was have as a banker genial and very intelligent , resigned before . 
some months after , is sospechó the reason . 
the fund of investment the bank is embarcó in losses with titles of high risk and had that amortizar thousands of million . 
for should with this , the bait announced a inyección of capital of nothing least that of 13 billion million of frf . 
for this found investors , course that some miraran with contemptuous to little before : a fund state asia and opaco of singapore and a fund state arab , so discreto , that never is had heard their name . 
this was only the first coup . 
in april of 2008 , empeoró . 
the bank had that on the loss of thousands of million , marcel ospel , president the council administrative , in 2006 in the second better paid council administrative of switzerland , resigned . 
in october of 2008 , she the disaster , in view of their investment wrong , the ubs is found in the crisis financial to the dear and had that be rescatada for the state . 
the bank national compró values problem to the ubs for many thousands of million , the confederation helvética was six thousands of million of frf for a bono out all , by the that is convertía in copropietaria the bank . 
all switzerland was affected , is stated what dramatic that was this for a country small , if aloja to banks so large . 
finally the sum the balance of the ubs in 2007 was more of five sometimes greater that the results economic of switzerland ( see gráfica ) . 
&quot; not we again to rescue to the ubs &quot; , said geiger , expert in banca . 
to the first disaster is joined the second . 
few months after , the ubs capituló in a conflict tax with america and is was ready to therefore the data of the customers wealthiest , that possibly had defraudado tax with aid the bank . 
also , bound a figure of were thousands of million of dollars , point of profits injustificados of these business with a compensation for payment . 
with this , the ubs confesó more or least have helped in the fraud tax . 
simultaneously lost something that had been since always their capital in the competition for customers rich : the aureola of discretion . 
after the scandal , the secret the bank scheduled already not is the same . 
to this rise the lövin the president of the junta directive and the president the council administrative . 
and the assessment of the funds of the customers . 
of this way , in few months the bank lost their credibility in their two sectors central : in the banca of investment by the speculation flawed and in the administration of goods by the aid the fraud tax . 
and fair when back to be something more has , fair when is i that the ubs back to this , is this desdichada history the for , a for individual defraudó 1,7 billion million of eur , before of that the bank is diera account of that something was is . 
and is desveló , for what seen , this still not works well with the management of risk in the banca of investment . 
&quot; with the case adoboli is world that the controls of risk have changed too little &quot; , says martin janssen , professor of economy and finance in the institute banking of the university of zurich . 
the director financial of a great bank german also is sure : &quot; the problem of the ubs is that not terms the controls of risk &quot; . 
for what that about the idea of the caution , with the that the bankers on is demands since ago time , be the do of the are goods the world : no risk too large , in change , the security the money to quebrar the another on of the republic living . 
the second of security of the banks on were the symbol of the reliability inquebrantable , as lindt and sprüngli the chocolate genuine . 
the central of the ubs in zurich not extension with the buzz the sound bank private scheduled , only is a little greater . 
the situation is classical . 
the bank has their based main in the street bahnhofstraße of zurich , that is since the station main directly the amongst of zurich , enmarcado for the summits covered of snow of the mountains suizas . 
here the buildings are ostentosos , the turned are a of the more higher of europe . 
here is are joyerías as tiffany`s between business traditional on as the confitería sprüngli . 
here they since ago years the banks on : since the bank national , and for the palacio of credit suisse , to the elitarios banks private as julius bär . 
is will in the room of reception of the ubs by a heavy door chair . 
within the walls are revestidas of mármol , front is are large sillones of such , together the logo the bank there a great letrero for indicate the &quot; security &quot; . 
the ubs know what that the client search here : security . 
the two large banks on , the ubs and credit suisse , in some at have desplazado the idea the great bank scheduled , or the have betrayed , as view the president of a small bank private scheduled . 
prefer not read their name in the newspaper , the end and the out ago , as all the bankers on , also with the business of both large banks . 
the ubs is has fact too large , view , mainly in the banca of investment , where the exposed have cattle ground . 
there the on not had nothing more that say . 
&quot; and is have have for a time to the our of the exposed . &quot; 
of fact , the ubs changed the banca of investment with , relevant their first great terms and then wine the disaster , no entity financial european had lost therefore money in the jungla the high risk as the great bank scheduled . 
the 15 of october of 2008 , the disaster was clear . 
&quot; that wednesday the coalition government the small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of their nation &quot; , says the author lukas hässig in their book &quot; de ubs-crash &quot; ( &quot; the crash of the ubs &quot; in spanish ) . 
the political over to 68 thousands of million of frf or approximately 45 thousands of million of eur for save the great bank of the bancarrota . 
do how is them happens ? 
is about with the bankers on , so are the problem in the dimension of the ubs . 
in june of 1998 , two of the three large banks on is fusionan in a poderoso consortium . 
from a bank that , because to the merger , was too large for the small switzerland , and still growing . 
for what that was for that the two different banks precursors of the ubs is complementaran : a bank rico but doesn with the centre of the administration of goods in zurich and a internacionalización more poor but more strong . 
of suddenly , the banks of investment internacionalizados came of way well with a money , with the that could to rodar a great bicycle financial . 
there two names related with this said of the ubs : peter wuffli , head the consortium of the ubs of 2001 to 2007 , and marcel ospel , then president the council administrative . 
&quot; always i that wuffli and ospel were a team perfect &quot; , says the expert in banca hans geiger . 
&quot; wuffli , the intellectual , modest , that understand a of models and statistics , and ospel , the intuitivo that managed greece step since the learning in the bank to the summit . &quot; 
finally , ospel is fió of wuffli . 
and the end wuffli was probably a mistake decisive : &quot; was that their models were a reality &quot; , says geiger . 
&quot; is a case tragic . &quot; 
tragic , perhaps . 
is clear : the desatino was before the case . 
the employees of the ubs is remember clearly of the meetings of that , in the that wuffli , the head the consortium , always repetía the same motto : down the telling to doing sachs . 
the bank american was the bank of investment more poderoso the world . 
encabezaban the &quot; league tables &quot; , the clasificaciones that then documentaban the success of the banks . 
the ubs wanted be in the summit . 
some steps you requirement well . 
in the operations of divisas and in the negotiating of actions was in what more high . 
without however , the as of companies makers put of highlighted a point weak : in the business the interest international , in the language of banca &quot; fixed income &quot; , there a compensation huge for the large banks . 
the ubs has vacíos in the products hipotecarios american . 
for fill these vacíos , the ubs started a adventure that almost you costs their existence . 
Ávidos of growth , invirtieron therefore the same bank as one of their funds of high risk created in investment american of high risk . 
is transformed in a machine powerful for titularizar appropriations hipotecarios american and venderlos to continuation , manteniendo certain risks to account own . 
and also , as other banks arrangement the bajada for a time . 
&quot; in summer of 2007 , as the market estate american was in llamas , the ubs compró there &quot; , said geiger , expert in banca . 
so large the euphoria , so system the fall . 
a terms had that go , already that the attempt of one was more complicated of what that would . 
the jobs in the ubs is became in seats proyectables and are inseguros to the today . 
currently , who at a great bank , has a work almost impossible . 
must find a strategy for a bank , to the that all the models of business lógicos are around . 
geiger , expert in banks , has a idea , to end to the banca of investment , focus in the administration of goods , return to the roots suizas . 
the bank not to come so far ( still ) . 
but the banca of investment must reduce a , is clear currently . 
the next thursday , sergio ermotti , the new president the bank , will their future strategy the world . 
in reality , only is was in the italiano-suizo of 51 years as a solution ought , already that the bank the bank is separó before of their predecessor grübel . 
meanwhile , he is imposed : must you of way permanent the business of the ubs , comunicó the bank of zurich the tuesday . 
ermotti to restore the bank of investment to their state to mid of the nineties . 
no 3.500 jobs . 
but this not enough . 
the ubs needs a vision . 
do who is ? 
do with what to win money ? 
these are the questions that sure is ago axel about currently . 
to the at only says that first buscará a housing with their woman in zurich .

massacre to level personal 
the eu and generous new book of peter englund , the beauty and the pain of the battle ( the beauty and the sorrow ) : a history íntima about of the first war world , &quot; beginning with a long dramatis personae the kind that can to that to one is you caiga the soul to the feet . 
i here some by of action : testing suavemente this indeed and conviértala in their mark pages . 
will to know very well to these people in the narración novelística the mr englund , and this dramatis personae will as their gps , a faro for these few at in the that , as one of their men and women , is confusing and desamparado in the fog of the war . 
the mr englund is a i and journalist swedish . 
also is the new secretary permanent of the academy swedish , that here the prize nobel of literature . 
what that has writing here is a book little aware , that describes , rightly , as &quot; a work of anti-historia &quot; . 
contains some names in , treaties important or dutch battles ; virtually not there ambassadors , elegant journalists or discussions on holdings or material . 
not is therefore a book about of what happened , explains , as &quot; a book about of how happened &quot; . is about of &quot; feelings , from , experiences and states of humour &quot; . 
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; being the experiences in times of war of more or least 20 men and women ordinarias , to both both of the war , since colegialas and botánicos to escaladores , doctors , drivers of wound and administrative . 
some of these people is convertirán in who . 
some is convertirán in prisoners of war , or will their member , is will driven or morirán . 
their lives parpadean here as velas votivas encendidas in a church ; a new is in to the a while other is go . 
the book the mr englund is a handicap of the books of history standard . 
is also a correctivo to the notion of that the first war world only was the funesta war of trincheras in the with western . 
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; is all of way particularly to through of other teatros of war : the alps , the balkans , the with eastern , mesopotamia , africa the this . 
to the soldiers in this book them give above the colmenas ; one is the christmas in egypt under the pirámides ; the sledgehammer tse-tse are a problem intratable . 
this is a book conmovedor , almost since the start . 
the war inunda the lives of these people as a disaster natural , a hurricane scene that apesta to cordita . 
when the fire of it is as in the distance , and you a woman that is in home with your children , do you quedas or huyes ? 
of all forms do who next ? 
almost one understand what that is and , or even for what is has that fight this war . 
&quot; we of facts &quot; , seriously the mr englund , &quot; is has rellenado with conjeturas , suposiciones , hopes , made , ideas those , kotler of the conspiración , are , pesadillas and bring &quot; . 
&quot; the beauty and the pain of the battle &quot; still to individuals as florence farmborough , a contracting english in the army russian , and richard stumpf , a young marinero german of the fleet of high sea . 
their stories is have obtained in their greater part of bait , letters and another material already published before . 
the explanations of their lives can be aterradoras or conmovedoras , but are more vaults of life in the accumulation of small at , details around , the mr englund . 
many of these are about of privaciones and of adorned with what that there . 
about of have the history of a colegiala german says : &quot; sucedáneos , for all parties sucedáneos &quot; . 
&quot; sucedáneo of coffee , aluminium untrue , nets of imitation , vendas of role , botones of wood . &quot; 
continues about of the food sucedánea in germany . 
describes &quot; meat made to from of rice cocido and prensado in blubber of 02 ( and rematado with a hueso untrue fact of wood ) ; tobacco fact of roots and peladuras of potatoes petrol ; shoes with suelas of wood &quot; . 
there , seriously , &quot; 837 substitutes permitidos of the meat in the production of salchichas , 511 substitutes the coffee registered &quot; . 
some stories are about the honour and the value . 
a american recognised their own momentum towards the who and world about of the war : &quot; sientes that , after of all , this is for what that the men are some and not for who in sillones with a cigarro and a moonshine , the newspaper of the later or a apos seller , and by that that just means civilisation and that not there a barbaric behind of that pechera almidonada and tachonada . &quot; 
in change a soldier british is does account of that probably morirá , and of that one is enterará or you importará . 
&quot; a time that one is resigna the thought of sacrificarse , to one you like think that could consider front the public &quot; , says . 
in change , is horriblemente apos &quot; to a condemned being estrangulado in secret &quot; . 
other comments are about of a old europe soon , and about of new types of terror . 
&quot; the conflict is has become every time more in a competition economic &quot; , says the mr englund , &quot; a war between factories &quot; . 
reflects the arrival of what that he out &quot; a new kind in the bestiario the young century : the murderer in mass elocuente and convinced ideológicamente with ropas of good seeing that executes their fighters while is at behind of a escritorio &quot; . 
the people is means of ways imprevistas ; there therefore behaviour innoble as heroico . 
the mr englund about of the soldiers that us actively take a disease venérea of estonian as way of evade the service in the with . 
&quot; the expression more thus of this is can see the trade of relative gonocócico , that the soldiers buy and embadurnan with this their genitales with the hope of end in the hospital &quot; , says . 
&quot; those that are truly about what frotan on their eyes , what that to often does place to a ceguera of for life . &quot; 
in this translation the swedish made for peter serious , the prosa the mr englund ágil but not extravagante , is perfectly adaptada to their task human . 
in dozens of small scenes reflects the way in the that the war to &quot; up forces excepcionalmente incontrolables : nationalism extreme , revolution social , hatred religious &quot; . 
the people it to ask for what their leaders them are doing combat . 
the best books about of the first war world to often have been indirectos , as the great war and the memory modern of paul fussell , or novelas as without element in the with of erich maría remarque , in time of stories integrales . 
the volume the mr englund is unite to a fellow little conventional . 
their book has one of the end more summer that i remember in a labour of not fiction . 
not what revelaré . 
but is as if would come since their book , arrancado of between your it that indeed of dramatis personae , and the would again with a cerilla .

the memorándum his the word &quot; surplus &quot; for unsuccessful the action , to despite of that &quot; surplus &quot; describes with greater often the act of enterprises to a fighting of the nómina of a school to a exchange of work , whose just are paid for the office central . 
&quot; sixty and six all of parents were dismissed &quot; , says the draft of the complaint , &quot; and not only in surplus &quot; . 
mission draw , the congress prepared for come to a agreement on libya 
seems that finally republican and democrats in the nerve are prepared to only of agreement on something related with the embargo in libya . 
all what that is needed was that the rebellion had success , that the off dictator muamar the gaddafi outside just and murdered and the participation of states united was to their end . 
the tuesday , the committee of affairs foreign the senate is to be a resolution , patrocinada for the president john kerry ( democrat for massachusetts ) , together with the senadores john mccain ( republicano for arizona ) and wresinski i. lieberman ( independent for connecticut ) , aplaudiendo to the who for their successful rebellion and to the troops of ee.uu. for their &quot; courage &quot; . 
&quot; this resolution is for honrar to the valientes of libya , the start to rebuild their country &quot; , said kerry . 
&quot; is a claim of support bipartidista for their s democratic . &quot; 
the language can appear inofensivo , but nothing on the debate on libya has been easy to now . 
this summer , the legislators of both parties is peleaban between yes and with the home white on the significant of a series of resolutions for approve or reject the role of the military of ee.uu. in the mission of the nato in libya . 
in june , kerry and mccain tabled a resolution that forming the use limited of forces military of ee.uu. in libya . 
the project of law was derrotado in the house for a broader for bipartidista , and that never was to votarse in the senate . 
but the same day in that the project of law was rejected in the house , the house also rejected a measure that would recortado the funds for the operations americans in libya . 
what he the mission of ee.uu. in a kind of from legislative - with the congress what enough means as for criticise the within for part of obama of the mission , but not so enfadado as for in reality segar the hierba under their feet . 
to continuation , the indecisión the congress was superada for the events . 
trípoli fell in hands of the rebels who in august , and gaddafi was murdered the 20 of october . 
the mission of the nato end officially the 31 of october . 
now the senate could be group for act . 
the resolution the committee of affairs foreign &quot; so the people of libya for their tremendo courage and extraordinary resistance for shake to yes ourselves &quot; and &quot; considering to the men and women of the forces armed of states united and to their partners of the coalition that took in operations military for protect the people of libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism &quot; . 
the resolution also &quot; states the interest national of the states united in a successful and commitment transition towards the democracy in libya . &quot; 
do point the new measure the completely support of the commission of affairs foreign , or dividirá to the legislators as was the project of law of june ? 
the last version was rejected for the senator richard g. place ( indiana ) , the main republicano the committee . 
the spokesman of place said the monday that not had seen still the version end the new project of law . 
the another on the nerve , the house is to vote this week on a amendment constitutional demanding a budget balanced , a priority legislative for almost all the congresistas republican and some democrats . 
the measure , patrocinada for the republicano something goodlatte ( republicano for the ) , will the first amendment constitutional on the budget or any another issue that of fact logre a vote of all the house in the house or the senate in this congress . 
other legislators not have had success to the at for to come their amendments to the house , but not for lack of especially . 
the of goodlatte is only a of the 68 amendments constitutional that is have austria in this congress , that abarcan a wider range of subjects . 
some are duplicados - the same project of law is proposes therefore in the house as in the senate - and other with small costing between yes . 
there for what least 15 versions of the amendment the balance budgetary so only in the house , and another handful that &quot; fucino the expenditure federal . &quot; 
some of these projects of law also are idénticos between yes , but give to their patrocinadores - on all republican rather that for refinar their currículums - the opportunity of jactarse of that them were the &quot; authors &quot; of this measure . 
the law of control of budget , that was adopted in august , requirió that therefore the house as the senate his a amendment the balance budgetary . 
in march , from senadores voted to favour of a resolution not binding that supports the idea of that amendment . 
more beyond the budget , several member want limit the number of mandatos that the member the congress can to , while that the representative josé e. serrano ( democrat for new york ) , to validity the limit of two mandatos for the presidents . 
the representative jesse l. jackson jr . ( democrat for illinois ) has proposed a series of amendments that an the right to a education of quality and attention health , between other subjects . 
a amendment that from the marriage homosexual is a proposal perenne , so as a that from the burning of flags . 
some legislators also want allow the ii of the laws federal if are been for two thirds of the states . 
so enthusiasts that have been the member to the time of propose amendments , not is are pulling to a pace more quickly that in years previous . 
in the 111º congress , the legislators proposed 77 amendments , and tabled 66 in the 110º . 
the pace is unacceptable in compared with the of the in of 1990 , when the member demands regularly more of 150 amendments every two years , according figures proporcionadas for the library the senate . 
but not had a more success then of what that what have now . 
the last amendment that is added - the 27 - was fellow in 1992 , but of fact was proposal for the congress in 1789 . 
&quot; hit but not derrotada , &quot; giffords about in their first interview in broadcasters since the town 
ten months after of that a pistolero you disparara to quemarropa in a act assembly in tucson , the representative gabrielle giffords ( democrat for arizona ) about in the television national the night the monday , sung accompanied of the melodía of broadway &quot; the sun nothing morning &quot; and said that wanted recuperarse more of what that wanted return the congress .

the programme special analizaba the recovery of giffords since the town the 8 of january . 
in videos causing for yearold in the first weeks , is the is in their bed of hospital , with the head afeitada and a long cicatriz politics their with . 
she only can keep one or two it erguidos , while their husband the encourages .

in the interview with sawyer , giffords , that ago two hours of been all the days , said that not reminds the day the town . 
their bearing said that was leyéndole to giffords a article the newspaper on the murder the 12 of march when she what down for ask for first time about of the six that had died in the incident . 
the pistolero suspect , jared reads loughner , is is arrested in a prison of partly and is being medicado for the force while expected trial . 
&quot; very people died &quot; , you said giffords to sawyer . 
&quot; hard , hard , hard . &quot; 
yearold you said to sawyer that in a at of the recovery of their wife , she said : &quot; i been derrotada . &quot; 
&quot; so that , i you i , &quot; &apos; gabby , not you been derrotada , &apos; &quot; said yearold . 
&quot; so only you been hit . 
and you to out of this , and you to recuperarte and you to again with more force that never . &quot; 
the troops do felt more lástima that respect 
the event was a by of wall street that recaudó million of dollars for the veteranos without home in new york . 
kid simonyi sung a balada on the powerlessness , the frustration and the loss . 
in that at , several hundreds of soldiers , sailors , aviadores and infantes of of into in their jobs in about to he . 
the a of though is it of ordinary and aplaudieron . 
&quot; the men and women were who as who &quot; , said david saltzman , who organised the desire of funds of spring . 
a official military of high ranking in the by , also known as the then president the state greater whole , the almirante mike mullen , was the role of the troops of way different . 
&quot; the were as a kind of child huérfano &quot; , wrote the official in a mail e . 
i sure of that the organizers they good intentions . 
is that the they . 
but not was respect , of truth . was lástima . 
the from marcadamente contradictory illustrate the difficult relationship that is has sign of the military and a public us to often distante , to sometimes , adorador . 
is prodiga to the troops with praise for their handouts . 
but the alabanza has a price , say the member the service . 
the public every time more it as if you dieran it those uniformados . 
&quot; not we victims in at &quot; , said the general of brigade are b. macfarland , who comandó the troops in iraq and soon partirá towards afghanistan . 
&quot; but seems that the only way of that some willingness their support is put to us in the role of souls desamparadas . &quot; 
the issue is a issue very sensitive for the leaders military , that not want appear desagradecidos or in disagreement with the public the that serve . 
also is give account of that the ira to the that is enfrentaron the troops that were in the last years of the war of vietnam was a worst . 
as result , the majority of the discussions on the lástima is have to out in silence and in private between the veteranos of war . 
after of that their two children were of combat with the infantería of of , the colonel withdrawn mark cancian them would of that the people from of the military being their service since two prospects . 
some them mirarían with a sense of fear because to that is enfrentaron to the insurgents and they to places exóticos . 
other is preguntarían if would a &quot; off enojado and violence below of the surface &quot; , said cancian , that fought in iraq and back to a work of high level the government in washington . 
for their search of employment , said , felt that some entrevistadores you had was sutilmente if would capable of aguantar under the pressure of a challenging work of washington immediately after of their revolves of which . 
&quot; when hablas about of your service , necesitas to with to the from negative &quot; , reminded cancian contándoselo to their children . 
from the concern military , in part , of the fighters us towards the wars . 
the achievements in the field of battle are rarely time elected for the alabanza for part of a country that has little familiaridad with the military and is few profits direct of the wars of iraq and afghanistan . 
&quot; us , as nation , already not we the heroísmo military of ways that were the all common in the second war world &quot; , said the sincere general withdrawn david barno , who comandó the troops of ee.uu. in afghanistan . 
in change , the praise of the political and the public is his in great measure in the depth the suffering of a member the service . 
the troops are recognised for the number of giras that have soportado , the number of friends that have lost or the reach of their injury . 
the army afronta a growing pressure for end with the violation 
this week , a hearing historic decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army for their called out to the violation . 
if not , hundreds of complainant is are organising for the next . 
the soldier of first elizabeth lyman had 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in the that she says that was bore for a about . 
was october of 2008 , and is respected of return to their guardia in the basis airline miramar , the north of st diego , after of the dinner with a friend when is found with a colleague that was a package of 12 latas of beer . 
he you asked if could joining to she in their room for take a cup . 
&quot; sonó a signal of alarm &quot; , says lyman . 
without however , the nativa of texas he to a on their concern . 
i , not , has 19 . 
&quot; is of texas &quot; , says . 
&quot; may would heard to my violates . &quot; 
to the few minutes of into in the room of lyman , the man is you acercó for behind , tirándola towards collapsed and violándola , does . 
this week , the 18 of november , lyman and other 27 member the personal military current and old expect ansiosamente a decision legal in a trial historic that is will in arlington , the , that decide if the demand that have interpuesta against the exsecretario of defence robert philips and their way , donald rumsfeld , sit to trial . 
the demand does that philips and rumsfeld top in the reduction of the violation widespread between the military , in violation of the rights constitutional of the soldiers . 
a in february for susan burke , a who of washington , d.c. , the demand was m to 17 complainant , but creció to 28 in the months following , 25 women and three men , all them which that were violados or agredidos sexually for their colleagues , and that the army lituania to the time of with , assertion , or foods justice appropriate after of the supuestas subjected . 
burke says that is to for the people greater the army , because the problem beginning with them . 
&quot; the army is a structure of down towards collapsed &quot; , says . 
&quot; do who are the people that are in conditions of in the culture of the represalias ? the high was . &quot; 
burke also says that since february , is have since in contact with she close of 400 them more , many of the which could be part of future demands . 
their strategy : in place of accrue to all the complainant in this case , by all the eggs in a same basket , for so say , is to it several cases , of be necessary , for keep the pressure . 
the team of the defence for the department of defence , encabezado for the tax federal neil macbride , has have a motion for be the case . 
the documents the court , and for newsweek , detailed the strategy of defence -en essence , that the military not can be demandados for soldiers current or old for the injury if in the forces armed . 
for a ruling the court supreme of 1950s called the already feres , the government federal not is responsible for the damage sufridos for the personal in service active . 
&quot; the damage alegados are part the service military of the complainant &quot; , say the documents . 
the department of defence is refused to to comments for this article . 
the things have changed since the years 50 . 
while that to the women still them is officially ban serve in which , this distinction is only call : the wars modern rarely time have clear the lines the with . 
therefore in iraq as in afghanistan , the equipment of women soldier are desempeñando papers every time more important , especially for come to the women local in areas of war . 
the result : between these two wars , 150 women soldier have died and two thirds of them in situations of which . 
is time of that the army also is modernice , says burke . 
she not is single in their fight , and other three demands are in into , also the their . 
in the faculty of right of yale , the clinic of services legal for veteranos is for a case against the four main language military for supposed promote a environment misógino . 
for other part , the organisation without that of profit vietnam veterans of america is his a demand against the army that is on in the our of &quot; delayed of the status &quot; year to the victims of violation with the end of them the high the service -un and common , according the activists , as anu bhagwati of the network of action of women in service , a group of rights human . 
their group presented a demand in december against the administration of veteranos , acusándola of practices discriminates in the way in that apos the complaints of profits for the people that say have been agredidas sexually in the service . 
is have have nine projects of law for separate in the congress for part of a a bipartidista of senadores and representatives , for a series of votes . 
in 2010 there 3.158 subjected sexual denunciadas , according the office for the prevention of the aggression sexual and answer the department of defence . 
without however , the subjected are a infra denunciadas , and for the own estimates the pentagon , that figure in approximately the 13,5 for per of the 19000 incidents ladies that is there that year . 
the report , published in march , also on the population of prosecution : in 2010 , a 20 for per of the cases denunciados in the army was to trial - the half that in the system of justice civil . 
the complainant in the case of burke , describen their attacks as only the first of a series of there . 
in the case of lyman , recently the presunta violation to the police military least of a time after of that ocurriera . 
that night , says , is you asked that contara the details of their violation 11 sometimes various to a a of police , doctors , and staff . 
she is concluded to a kit of violation , and the blood of their agresor -de a court in their brazo- was discovered in their bed . 
six months after , in april of 2009 , lyman relocation to a hearing to a judge , for the which is you asked about of that would had relations sexual with their novio the day the attack . 
six people apos as witnessing of status in name the ’ author , that was finally absuelto . 
&quot; i the day in that is his the extent &quot; , says lyman . 
&quot; i that i was to go the work -me i shouting since the room . &quot; 
&quot; i put in the unit of psiquiatría , and when i , i that you i to my official of was , &quot; &quot; that not was their trial . that was my trial &quot; . 
to lyman is you public visit to a psiquiatra military , that finally you as a delayed of the status , what that the was not apta for the service . 
in january of 2010 was dispensada the service under terms menos-que-honorables , what that you from receive any benefit . 
in as to if the case have for lyman and their colleagues of demand continues , is a possibility very german , says john turley , professor of right in the faculty of right orwell washington . 
without however , out , &quot; in my opinion , should be able of to forward &quot; . 
what that is interpone between them and a extent is this already that has been criticada since that is published for first time . 
i been a critical permanent of the already feres . 
the army is decades for behind because not has the same incentive and a that with the responsibility . 
and adds : &quot; the back are are in against of them ... but is important for them try . &quot; 
these things only period when the people good is ready to fight . 
if the hearing not is for their way , burke , who of the complainant , will to the eu to their other hundreds of complainant for cases future . 
&quot; we to to fighting against the army in this issue to that the reform is would &quot; , says . 
&quot; or to that we muramos , what that happen first . 
the walls have eyes : how the researchers you are at in facebook 
before of become in the new face of the extreme right in europe , anders behring breivik was simply another kind that aireaba their points of view anti-inmigración in line . 
the monday , breivik , who calmly have done a killing in norway in july , that he 77 dead , is apos to their first hearing legal public . 
while breivik can have action only , was far of be only in the ciberespacio : had last the greater part the time that preceded to their attack with to their computer , charlando with some of the million of nationalists that support to the groups of right in networks social . 
after of the tragedy of this summer , the researchers wanted know more about of these people . 
but , do how encontrarlas ? 
easy - only you that into in facebook . 
&quot; we we account of that not was so difficult come to them &quot; , says jamie bartlett , author main of a report published recently on the populism digital european for the centre of studies british let . 
the alijo of information personal of facebook is so enciclopédico , says bartlett , that the researchers could simply use the tool of advertising for determine their characteristics demográficas deseadas with a precision scientific - the way that the sellers have state being for years . 
the team of bartlett found a million of fan of the groups of right in all europe and then them dirigieron announcements , but in place of vincularles to a new such or product of dieta , the announcements invitaban to the users to complete a survey that he on their level education , attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on their own future . 
the come to through of facebook , bartlett and their colleagues were able of to to more of 10.000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 countries european - all without out of the office . 
&quot; is a way completely new of to a research &quot; , says bartlett . 
some of the results not are the all surprising : the supporters in line of the groups of right tend to be young , men and enfadados for the immigration . 
without however , in a kind of rise , &quot; those that own their activismo in line with the activismo outside of line are more reasonable , more democratic and least violent that those that is are behind of the screen the computer &quot; . 
the work of let is only a example of how facebook is is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists . 
centres of research , researchers doctors and scientists political are being the get for to all , since problems of health to trends social such as is apos in the &quot; i like &quot; , messages in the walls and dialogues of state . 
with more of 800 million of users active agregando a average of three parts of content the day , the &quot; supernova of data &quot; of facebook is and a on of the research , for the number of jobs academic with the name the get in the title to almost a 800 % in the last five years . 
for some researchers , the beauty of facebook is that you allows to to the people to the that not podías acercarte with a carpeta in the street . 
&quot; before , when intentabas encuestar to people the party national british , was very difficult identificarlos . &quot; 
&quot; tendrías that go to through the party , and them never you creation the access &quot; , says bartlett . 
&quot; facebook would all that - you to them directly . &quot; 
other say that the get could provide a way of identify and address the problems of salud-social . 
a study recent done for the doctora megan seaside , of the university of wisconsin-madison and their colleagues , found that the students it that they of their hazañas of borrachera in facebook they a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink that the students that refused in silence on the issue . 
seaside suggests that the colleagues of the students , such as the order residenciales , could control the get and intervene for help to a student that into too dialogues of state with their binge . 
&quot; not you treat a problem if not what you diagnosticar &quot; , said and christakis , the co-autor of seaside and director the centre of health , behaviour and development the child in the institute of research child of seattle , said the washington post . 
&quot; we found a way of identify children in risk that of another way not would diagnosticados . &quot; 
facebook also is constantly &quot; pinchando &quot; to their own population for obtain data . 
the team of data the get has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the day of st gold , the expectation of participation electoral to half the period legislative of 2010 , and a rate of Škottová national ( mainly being the information to the that is can access - defenders of the freedom digital ago a time that people that the get should to to available of other their great amount of data for the research ) . 
without however , the users of facebook know that the get them is looking , them whether or not - the sacrificio for power play the scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that the get mine your information personal . 
but do what is when the users of facebook spend to be part of a survey that or even know ? 
while that the researchers have guidelines well office on how up their data outside of line , in line is a barra free for all . 
&quot; not i that many of the users have thought even in the fact of that a scientists could be examining their profiles &quot; , says neil selwyn , a todd the laboratory of knowledge of london , on a study of 2006 that was to out with the walls public of facebook of students . 
&quot; in what that to them precise , was only between them and their friends . &quot; 
then is the question of the methodology . 
even outside of line , not there guarantee of that a issue of research this being completely honest . 
in facebook , is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a user and of the messages the wall are truth . 
&quot; what that dices in facebook and what that pensioner outside of facebook are two things completely different &quot; , says selwyn . 
is for that that , to despite of their years as scientists of the technology , selwyn believes that a sujetapapeles and a bolígrafo are being the best tools of research that one can use . 
&quot; not there substitute for into in the world real and about with the people real &quot; , says . 
&quot; the research social is is that is on what social - and a lot of what social still is outside of line . &quot; 
&quot; cold and inhuman : anders behring breivik ago their first emergence public in the court 
anders behring breivik , the man that confesó be the brain of the two attacks that killed to 77 people in norway this summer , is has to to yes same as a combatiente of the &quot; resistance &quot; for their first emergence public in the court of oslo . 
&quot; i a commander military in the movement of resistance norwegian and in the apos templarios of norway &quot; , said to a room full with 500 people . 
&quot; i am the court , already that received the mandate of the organisations that support the ideology the hatred and because supports the multiculturalismo . &quot; 
&quot; i the facts but not i resumed guilty . &quot; 
the judge torkjel nesheim was to breivik for that monólogo , because &quot; not wanted give to breivik the opportunity of use this hearing as a platform for that exprese their points of view &quot; . 
for the same reason is refused to allow to breivik , that brought a speech writing with have , house to the family of their victims the end of the hearing . 
nesheim also public to the police keep to breivik under custody for 12 weeks more , you religious the access to the media of communication for four weeks , and said that the authorities should that have a at control on all the visits and the correspondencia for eight weeks . 
around of 30 them and family of the victims apply to the hearing . 
some as with the hope of look to breivik to the eyes , other for confirm that is is recluido under key . 
all apply with the aim of move towards the conclusion . 
&quot; i that seemed cold and inhuman &quot; , said a superviviente of utoya to the echo ​ ​ norway nrk . 
&quot; was you , but for me was a step forward after of see and hear the suspect . &quot; 
clothing with a suit dark and wearing blue , breivik is remained calmado and professional to what long of the hearing and miró to the journalists and to the them to the eyes when she and went the building . 
to despite of the strange notion of breivik of be part of a movement of &quot; resistance &quot; greater , the judge determinó that not is a ill mental , and said that not there evidence of that able with cómplices . 
is possible that to some them consuele that the attacks the 22 of july unimaginable be labour of a extremista in place of a group of radical . 
but that not suaviza automatically the pain and the confusion that all a nation still feel . 
&quot; i like that prompt a monster , but not what seems &quot; , said a family of a victim . 
&quot; would a more easy if what prompt . &quot; 
7 lessons of the interview patient of steve jobs , is show in a theatre this week 
after the death of steve jobs , the 5 of october , there some that what compararon with henry ford - distinguiendo the out of the technology as the great inventor modern . 
but what that the fan of apple could find more intend , in a interview to jobs recently redescubierta to the that is has desempolvado as deprived of a series of proyecciones special in the are markets this week , is how about this mind creativa about of the processes trade and flows of work of the products . 
was without doubt a designer , soñador and hippie autorreconocido , but also was a whoever meticuloso and a yonki of the diagramas of flow - a man that i that many place sufrían &quot; a disease that is in think that a great idea is the 90 for per the work ... &#91; but &#93; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product . &quot; 
in 1995 , something cringely was developing the series of television the triumph of the nerds ( the triunfo of the idiotas ) on the albores the computer personal , and is sit for more of a time with jobs for a can and rarely conversation . 
in that at had last old 10 years since that jobs had been forced to leave of apple , and already working turn in their new company it next , waiting the adoption popular of internet . 
while that a small part of the interview of cringely is used in nerds , said that the original of the interview existing for their transport . 
was only after of the death of jobs that is found a copy full in vhs in the philips the director . 
this material of for , slightly reeditado , is the basis of steve jobs : the interview patient , of 68 minutes , that is to the cines landmark this wednesday and thursday . 
for someone known for odiar the interviews in depth , jobs here seems before prepared to forward their gone tecnológicas and strategies trade . 
and very pensativo . 
in four points different to what long of the interview , there large silencios between the questions and the answers - of 10 to 15 seconds of reflexiones , where jobs is sopesando clearly their thoughts , for precision . 
also there at in the that the perfeccionismo of jobs its to the surface , where seems impaciente because to the questions of cringely , empujándole to go more quickly towards the subjects or arguments of greater importance . 
filmado before of the was of pixar , the ipod or the iphone , there something extrañamente profético in the interview patient , when jobs evalúa what that is that other companies do well and is , and offers their own vision the future of the it .

scalia and he cenan with the rival of the law of assistance health while the court on the case 
the day that the court by is met to door closed for at the question politically controversial of if aceptarían the challenge to the law of assistance health the president obama , two of their officers , antonin scalia and clarence he , were agasajados in a dinner patrocinada for the signing of lawyers that expondrá the case to the high court . 
the occasion was the last thursday , when the nine judges is met in a hearing a for to which the petitions of review . 
one of the cases in question was a demand a for 26 states seized the reform total of the assistance health adopted for the congress the year last , a law that has been a out of war for the activists conservatives in all the country . 
the officers acordaron admit to impossible the demand and , of fact , is expected a for historic of 5 hours and average for march , and the result probably enturbiará still more the career presidential of 2012 , that will in plenary for in the at in that the decision the court is no . 
the lawyer that comparecerá to the court and alegará that the law must be desechada will probably paul clement , who was as tax general of ee.uu. for the government of orwell w. bush . 
the signing of lawyers of clement , bancroft pllc , was a of the almost two dozens of companies that ayudaron to patrocinar the dinner annual of the society stronghold , a group that for many years into to the defence of the principles legal conservatives . 
other signing that patrocinó the dinner , jones day , represents to a of the associations trade that desafió the law , the federation national of business independent . 
another patrocinador was the giant farmacéutico pfizer inc . , that has a huge interest financial in the result the dispute . 
the dinner is took in a hotel of washington , hours after of the hearing a the court on the case . 
between the assistants was , between other , followed mcconnell , the republicano more important in the senate and a had of of the law of assistance health . 
do the invited special in the dinner ? scalia and he . 
not is nothing new : the two judges have state formation to events of the society stronghold for years . 
and not is something that between in conflict with the rules ethical . 
of fact , the judges are exentos the code of behaviour that controls the actions of the officers federal lower . 
if not what we , could said that caerían under the code canon 4c , that says : &quot; a judge can attend to events for certain funds of organisations related with the law and other , although the judge not can be a speaker , a invited of honour , or put in the programme of such event . &quot; 
without however , the proximidad absolute of scalia and he to two of the bufetes of lawyers in the case , so as to a company with a huge interest financial , was enough for alarmar to the activists of ethical in the government . 
&quot; this impressive gap of the ethical and fighters towards the code is in against of the demands of several officers that by the court for the same rules that is apply to all the judges federal &quot; , said something morin , the president of common cause ( cause common ) . 
&quot; the judges were agasajados in a desire of funds of by with lawyers that have cases outstanding to the court . &quot; 
their emergence and assistance in the desire of funds for this event undermines any demand of benefited , and is unacceptable . 
scalia and he have shown little interest for the criticisms that say that mezclan too easily the activity the court with the agenda impulsada for groups as the society stronghold . 
and the wife of he , ginni , is a ’ encountered conservative . 
for other part , the conservatives argue that is the magistrada just kagan , the that has a problem ethical , not scalia and he . 
kagan worked as procuradora general of the administration obama when is tabled the first challenges legal to the law in the court of first to . 
their critical have administration for that kagan is any of see the case , saying that was too involucrada in defend the law as for now be all . 
kagan not has given no indication of that what will to to .

the pentagon already is digiriendo the 450 billion million of dollars of away to what long of the next in , but now afraid a reduction additional of 600 billion million or more in cuts that can be afghanistan if the congress not manages come to a agreement on the expenditure . 
&quot; the impact of these cuts would devastating for the department &quot; , said panetta in a letter to the senadores john mccain , republicano for arizona , and lindsey graham , republicano for carolina the south . 
said that the failure the congress for come to a agreement on the budget and their result , the called &quot; previously &quot; , give place to a 23 for per of away global and a high to many projects new . 
&quot; a cut so large , applied of this way indiscriminada , would that the greater part of our projects sonars and of construction not is can apos - not is can buy three cuartas parties of a ship or a building - and damage seriously other efforts of investment &quot; , wrote panetta to the senadores . 
&quot; also we veríamos forced to apartar to many of our officials civil of way involuntaria and , because to that the reduction is impondría with so quickly , is almost sure that we that licenciar civil with the end of to the aim . &quot; 
&quot; these changes romperían the faith with those that have our army and dañarían seriously the good available . &quot; 
the cuts with the time alcanzarían to the troops of which , said panetta . 
&quot; if well the funding for times of war in the accounts of operations of contingencia in overseas not is is directly affected for the previously , the efforts of the war is would affected apos for the serious be in the budgets of basis &quot; , would panetta . 
&quot; the procurement of personal is reduciría , what that would to delays in the contracts and the supervision the contract that supports the war . &quot;

&quot; we strongly in against of this action draconiana &quot; , said the senadores in a release whole the later the monday when publicaron the letter of panetta . 
&quot; this not is a result with the that is can live , and certainly not is one that we trying to us ourselves . &quot; 
&quot; the previously is a threat for the interests of the security national of the states united , and not is must allow that happen . &quot; 
if the letter of panetta and the recent warnings of the senadores will the pressure for a compromise budgetary or cattle the called for eximir the pentagon of the cuts is for see .

&quot; is a ship without sailors . &quot; 
&quot; is a brigade without balas . &quot; 
&quot; is a back airline without enough pilots trained . &quot; 
&quot; is a tiger of role , a army of cuarteles , buildings and bombs without enough soldiers image for to the mission &quot; , said panetta in their words of opening in the pentagon . 
&quot; is a force that suffering the low moral , the preparation inadequate and not is capable of in the day with the potential adversaries . &quot; 
&quot; in effect , being to the aggression ... &quot; 
in a apéndice to their letters to mccain and graham , panetta enuncia new details of how the away &quot; beautiful important risks operational : too in the time of answer to the crisis , conflicts and disasters ; limited severamente our capacity of be you and is a in all the world ; and is a risk unacceptable in future operations of which . &quot; 
and panetta said that some of the are projects of defence could with the hacha , including those that already is are probando and some only in the first stages of the planning . 
this list includes the air of which f35 work strike fighter , a new bombardero to , the submarino balístico of new generation , the new ship of which coasts and the new vehicle of which in land that the army and the of need replace , the humvee . 
stop the development and the evidence additional the f35 could generate a 80 billion million of dollars in being to what long of 10 years , but their supporters say that is the next step vital for improve and with the threats potential of china and other rival . 
as detect a lie 
a resolution to the headlines more recent we points med serious and curse are the deception and the lie in the life day . 
the candidate presidential republicano herman cain is occupied intercambiando accusations of harassment sexual with several women ; every part accused of lie to the other . 
the administrators of the university state of pennsylvania have been accused of perjurio for supposed conceal reports that were that a you of football withdrawn was agrediendo sexually to children . 
the week last , the president french , claus his , was &quot; pillado &quot; with a microphone open saying the president of ee.uu. , barack obama , that the first minister israeli course netanyahu is a do . 
lie has destroyed to and convulsionado countries . 
the congresista for new york and exhibicionista in internet , anthony weiner , was the ourselves with their desmentidos quickly rebatidos for the test irrefutable . 
the former candidate presidential john edwards has been accused of member in the funding of the campaign related with the encubrimiento of a relationship extramatrimonial . 
and , of new , one that what viviera olvidará never the circus mediático up for the president philips clinton the lie for their second mandate about of their relationship sexual with mónica lewinsky . 
are very extendidas the up on the traps in the examinations of the school and the university . 
is have given cases in the that the teachers have given the answers of the examinations to the students with the end of be better seen in their assessments of performance . 
mentores that should be enseñando what contrary are sending the message of that lie and is are volumes . 
do how deception we are ? 
in a day who , the studies show that you can lie in any place of 10 to 200 sometimes . 
that sure , many of these lies are lies piadosas . 
another study was that the issue mentían three sometimes in the first 10 minutes of conocerse . 
detect lies , or &quot; the in of lies &quot; , is a as essential that we acquire all , for reasons therefore personal as professionals . 
far of be a game of table similar to , for example , charada , where the aim is exclamar : &quot; you i &quot; , the detection the deception is a an the knowledge serious based in data scientists and for the last six decades in prestigiosas universities that took projects of research in depth , especially in psicología and fisiología . 
one of the results of the research is that the old mitos about of the lie have been rebatidos . 
the mentirosos yes who to the eyes . 
not always tartamudean , balbucean , is ruborizan or inquietan . 
not is can by not that the mentirosos are difficult of detect or unmasked . 
a detector of lies trained can come to the truth to about of the structure of the declaration , the expresiones microfaciales , the training of questions and the times . 
i several years sondeando the descubrimientos scientists on the deception in the from and always regarded body the knowledge , and was clear that the detection the deception is a technical modern that is easy of learn and aid to any for our complex world - especially if their responsibilities professionals include the procurement , interviews , or the management of negotiations . 
the good mentirosos have the as of read well to the others , precise felt to will , manejando their own emotion and sintiendo of way intuitiva how the were the others . 
we for the research that the extrovertidos mienten more that the introvertidos , that the men say more &quot; lies win towards yes ourselves &quot; , while that the women say more lies &quot; win towards the others &quot; -- normally for protect the feelings of someone -- that the people married mienten least often to their couples that the people that not are married ( but the lies that usually say tend to be &quot; enormous &quot; ) . 
also we that if you is just as a malhechor , the others is sentirán least guilty the mentirle . 
do how know if someone is mintiendo ? 
first , variation the behaviour the the inappropriate . 
this is out &quot; create a line of basis &quot; . 
aid to provide points of reference for measure after the changes . 
variation the position the inappropriate , risa and feature heard . 
is better that will if someone normally golpetea with the ordinary all the time for not to accusations unfair when you see the feet golpeteando in half of the meeting . 
to continuation , busque groups of behaviour hard , verbales and not verbales . 
quot to these groups of behaviour as signals of alarm , not as test of deception . 
the people that dupe can freeze the part higher the body the treat of remember their history , can emphasized their feet towards the door , inclinarse towards a exit , change their position of way significantly or exhibir a &quot; desahogo postentrevista &quot; -- that overstating suspiro of alivio and change of position a time that all the questions difficult have over . 
to often the interrogadores do see falsamente that the interview has over only for to that alivio postentrevista . 
also giving attention the vocabulary the inappropriate . 
has peterson metió the pata to the fund and usó the time last while stated that their wife murdered was viva , lanzando a search of she to level national . 
the people that dupe also can use a language distanciador : &quot; not i relations sexual with that woman ... the señorita lewinsky &quot; or repeat a question difficult fully . 
the indicators verbales more common are sutiles . 
someone can use a lot of &quot; language been &quot; when says to a question difficult : &quot; good ... to say truth ... to what that i is ... to my understand . &quot; 
this ago that the answer be a percepción in place of a fact and is to often a signal of vigilant . 
not there no formula mágica for detect lies , but develop skills for be the deception is possible . 
these skills will the for of who for avoid be victimizados for the artists of the such in their lives professionals and personal . 
the controversial plan the oleoducto departed after the threat the delay of ee.uu. in their discharge

i that all us always we we a little desconectados of the word grunge . 
when i in she , i reminds the gangs that given before , as mudhoney , soundgarden , nirvana and all the that from the same time , and , if there relevant now , i that is something marvellous because is music that is the it listen and gangs as mudhoney are doing now better music that never . 
the principle , their music had a content more dark and now is has again more positive . 
do to what is must this change ? 
is interesting because i that there a couple of songs in the new album that such time unimaginable more livianas , but also there songs , as the end or just breathe that as as songs very among although can sounding a little positive . 
with both , when ed i the tocó , lloré when the i and are songs deeply among . 
i that when creces and there some trauma in your life and is lose to a family or a friend , these things start to within your art and your music and these two songs , without doubt , for that for me .

do park or mountain ? 
the architects agreed in the opportunity of the call more beyond of all on being 
the contest municipal on the 16 doors reabre the debate on the role of collserola in barcelona 
amediados of the 80 , in plenary for of the already extinta s heavy of barcelona ( cmb ) , this administration imprimió a pasquines of promotion of collserola . 
the folleto definía the mountain as the great park of the barcelona heavy . 
is more , is acompañaba of a compared , in figures , with the central park neoyorquino . 
with the death of the cmb , in 1987 , the park came to situarse , in the an of many , as the limit higher of barcelona , being the capital catalana of the few that not is orientan in the s norte-sur but down ( mountain ) -abajo ( sea ) . 
the opinion of collserola as park natural apos in this idea . 
the reference already not was central park but yellowstone , with the jabalís in the role the oso yogi . 
in these is was to that , in september , the council convocó a megacompetición an for 16 notice for other many doors of access to collserola . 
a door proposed to the idea of park , without doubt . 
or that or someone to to doors the field . 
the question its single : collserola , do park or mountain ? 
the contest , therefore for their it merely organizativa as for what that is of reflection on the city is the issue of conversation between all the architects barceloneses . 
is almost already a issue recurrent the that it hand when two member of this former form of elected is recognise in a lift . 
and this fact does ordinary , exactly , to a of the few coincidencias between what that people three architects barceloneses , and teachers it , that is have have . 
miguel roldán , daniel mòdol and marta bayona : the contest is is . 
for roldán , after addressed the with coasts &quot; is ago necessary &quot; discuss on &quot; the with of mountain &quot; , all time that the speech of ildefons cerdà , the of the peaches greens , not is has taken to out . 
&quot; is from of the basis of that the park more wider of barcelona is the a . 
between other things for their great accesibilidad . 
collserola is more complex &quot; , ruling the within for who the title of &quot; doors of collserola &quot; within a &quot; trap léxica &quot; : not there that think in them &quot; as the accesos to a park , but the delimitación of a areas where there that act &quot; . 
mòdol , as roldán and bayona with experience in the world urbanístico , described the proposal of &quot; challenge intellectual &quot; with &quot; some dangers &quot; . 
dangers derivatives of what &quot; uncertain that is today day tried the space public &quot; after the experience vivida in the 80 and that had in the area the fòrum &quot; their am the cisne &quot; . 
the first fear is the own delimitación of a borders on where is can build . 
&quot; limit something is them already the next step &quot; , is say , their sobrepaso . 
&quot; there that think in new instruments urbanísticos , of planning , because the current &#91; in reference the plan general metropolitano ( pgm ) &#93; can give ordinary to auténticos disasters &quot; . 
more ceñido to the question , mòdol view that , simplificando , the it vallesana of collserola &quot; can regard as a park , the of barcelona , not &quot; , for a question merely topográfica . 
mòdol reminds that already there a work fact for the patronat of collserola that &quot; not must fall in together breaking &quot; , although thanks the opportunity that the council offers to their gremio of intervene in this project &quot; since the first at &quot; . 
and still more , understand that the cercanía of the mountain with the city is the police that allows to the architects into in the debate , but &quot; doubt &quot; on if is this profile technical the that must lead the equipment multidisciplinarios ( &quot; all a rightly &quot; , as ) that is have had that create : &quot; the architects we be only a tool &quot; . 
bayona nothing that the answer to the question that does title to this one is complex , because in the foundations the contest lack a vision global of collserola : &quot; is have scheduled 16 notice links -dice- in the sense montaña-mar , but not there a reading longitudinal , that see and understands the area in their whole &quot; . 
this from , the least in their case , that has choice for participate in the 16 notice . 
of another way , a project for a of the doors can chocar in programme and definition with the the within of the door of the on . 
in their opinion , that yes , the council should ensure that the strip immediately higher to the round of dalt should could , in all their spread , a area of equipamientos that efectuara a softly transition between the city and what green .

the last results of the research show that could have had multiple contacts with the ground . 
for the jobs of field is have found parts of the aeronave to a course of 9 billion 200 feet on the level a the sea , the ground is a outstanding that is since the seven degrees to 30 degrees of gradient . 
the photographs show the sequence in the that few is desarticuló to what long of said way . 
the information being elements that seem indicate that the single could have had multiple impactos in the ground . 
after of the search proper in a area more wider that the get acordonado , around the accident , not is have found parts all of the aeronave , what that strengthens the presumption of that the impact is presented in conditions of integrity structural . 
mss is protocol for means gene of obesity 
at the sure social a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young ; is supported in specialists the ipn 
the institute mexican the sure social ( imss ) announced that at a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young , called protocol &apos; genetic of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence &apos; , that will have with marcadores with the obesity . 
in a release , the head of the unit of research medical in bioquímica the hospital of especialidades the centre doctor national century 21st , miguel cross valverde , he that is house a team multidisciplinario of doctors , nurses , nutriólogos and workers social . 
said team is supported for specialists and a of postgrado the institute national of health public ( insp ) and the centre of research and of studies advanced ( cinvestav ) the institute politécnico national ( ipn ) . 
in the research is being to participate to the population be or not derechohabiente , come to the units sporting participants the imss in the valley of mexico , where is have to out the evidence to the under , all the i to from of the 8 : m hours . 
skills that the protocol started in the unit integrating cuauhtémoc ( state of mexico poniente ) and that since the 8 of october , the activity is for to out in the unit integrating nezahualcóyolt ( state of mexico east ) . 
a time that is a the aim of together to 500 or 600 under , the study given in the unit integrating independence ( south the district federal ) and finally in the unit integrating morelos ( the north the district federal ) . 
he that the purpose of this research is know the single and the importance of the genetic with on the development of the obesity and identify in children and young mexican factors of risk for prevent the emergence of diseases chronic degenerativas . 
the have this 14 of november the day world of the disease , precisó that the aim is together to three billion children and young between six and 14 years of age , with the consent and supervision of their parents , for the implementation of cuestionarios specific on food . 
also is them preguntará on the activity physical and background heredofamiliares of diseases , with the purpose of avoid factors of risk that desencadenen padecimientos as disease or recurrent renal . 
detalló that the i is them applies to all the participants measurements antropométricas ( weight , enormous , circumference of cintura ) , decision of pressure gauges , determination of the levels of glucosa , triglicéridos , colesterol and insulin and all ( is search identify genes that is asocien to the obesity child ) . 
cross valverde pointed that this research of to the concern of the professionals of the health for the alarming increase of weight in the under . 
&apos; the surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 began that in so only six years there a increase , in the case of the children , of 77 for per in obesity , and of the girls of 47 for per ; in terms of obesity also is observed a rise dramatic &apos; , skills the specialist the imss . 
followed that the justification for the search of the marcadores is sustenta in that the population the country from of other for their history genetic . 
informed that in average , the mexican has 65 for per of inheritance discussed american , 30 for per european and five for per african and this condition is reflects in the genes that is take to disease and too of weight . 
he that of way general , the genetic of the obesity is translates in the inability of like the too of energy that consumimos ( lowcalorie ) and that is stored in way of blubber . 
the scientists he that the benefit direct for the participants is the assessment all of the children , what that allows detect if have some degree of obesity or obesity . 
even , said , the presence of pliegues of colour obscuro ( acantosis ) in bottleneck and antebrazo , that show the likelihood of that padezca alteraciones metabólicas and to prediabetes . 
the information is apos of way confidential , the doctors the entregan for writing to the parents , to who is them explains every a of the measurements and the changes in the lifestyle of life that must to for prevent diseases . 
cross valverde he that there three single main that cause obesity , obesity and other padecimientos crónicos : the sedentarismo , that is the lack of activity physical day , remain the greater part the day at with the television and use media of transport in place of with travel used . 
also is must to the high ingesta calórica , is say , the greater consumption of alcohol azucaradas , of carbohidratos ( tamales , bread , pizza , hamburger , etc ) with high content in still and pork and the genetic that is analysing in this protocol . 
asphalt of the unam evitaría pretty 
raphael herrera , scientists of the faculty of chemistry of the unam , develops asfaltos modified with polímeros for produce a a with better every , regardless of the conditions environmental and of temperature 
if the signals that middle the pavimento like demands , not would necessary reparar close of 200 billion pretty every season of dry in the area heavy the valley of mexico , would raphael herrera nájera , scientists of the faculty of chemistry ( fq ) of the unam , who was that if the process of construction and peacekeeping of a pavimento asfáltico is the appropriate , the pretty could radioactivity in amount or , even , be for completely . 
in their conference a opinion technological of the pretty , dictada in the framework the year international of the chemistry , was to know that the laboratory to their office develops asfaltos modified with polímeros for produce a a with characteristics like to the the asphalt , but with a greater resistance mechanics , therefore to highest as to in temperatures . 
herrera nájera estimó that this kind of asfaltos modified could used in places where the climate is extremely a , as some cities the north the country , for improve their every and , for what therefore , the training of pretty . 
he that the asphalt , the part more heavy the oil , is a whole of moléculas of hidrocarburos , a of high weight molecular , called asfaltenos , and other of under weight molecular , called maltenos , that money you give the pavimento their readiness behaviour viscoelástico . 
the behaviour viscoelástico the asphalt is in that to highest temperatures , close of the turn degrees , is means as a liquid , to 120 degrees degree their viscosidad is very high and to 50 degrees degree is a state almost sound , while that to temperatures very in , the asphalt is again quebradizo , added . 
what previous means that in the streets the resistance the asphalt not is uniform , but that is is amendment for the day of agreement with the conditions environmental and of temperature , would the specialist in engineering chemistry . 
the scientists of the fq observed that the streets of the city of mexico in their majority are covered for pavimento flexible , the which is consists of six towards of materials , of the which the last three involucran the asphalt . 
between the towards more superficiales is is the carpeta asfáltica , conformada for small stones bañadas in asphalt and then compactadas . 
every a of the piedritas that is the carpeta , path , is bañada with asphalt . 
the transitar the vehicles and generarse efforts , this allows that the forces is are very well in the pavimento . 
if is like of asphalt amended is difundirían still better , at the an chemical . 
on the carpeta asfáltica , abundó , is put a last as called carpeta of rodadura , the which is made of a material of stone fine , is say , a bit that also is baña in asphalt . 
as is is of the as that is to be in contact with the llantas of the vehicles , must have more force mechanics that the carpeta asfáltica and provide fricción in the way . 
the be the part the pavimento that is to receive and essential the efforts , the carpeta of rodadura required , also , have the thick appropriate and is must they the material the that is made . 
the climate , especially the content and the costing of temperature , also are a factor very important to be , in special the water , said , because affects significantly the every of the carpeta asfáltica . 
when the ground is humedece , the water is you in the internal of the carpeta and is difficult that from , this increased a reblandecimiento of all the towards the pavimento and , for what therefore , the training of pretty . 
in the process of training of a bache , said , the first in desgastarse is the film of rodamiento and only after is affects the carpeta asfáltica , but the damage not happens instantáneamente , but that is a process that should atenderse to the first signals with suitable programmes of peacekeeping . 
the also member the system national of researchers he that the burden vehicular is another factor important in the training of pretty and , for this , the thick of every a of the towards the pavimento must go always in relationship with the burden vehicular and ensure that is a , for avoid that is them pretty often . 
raphael herrera would that still there a that with and work on the asphalt , for example , the emulsiones asfálticas , that in other countries already is are even in the market and it reparar the pretty with easily and without need of use highest temperatures . 
do what you concluded to the candidate the valley for be the new señorita colombia ? 
analysis of the factors that incidieron for that melina ramírez serna not alcanzara the percent of señorita colombia . 
the valley a their title number 14 of princess . 
of new the valley the cauca is is with the to of the percent of señorita colombia . 
this time melina ramírez serna is had that shaping with be in the podio of ganadoras , lucir the percent of silver and the such that the acreditan as new princess of colombia . 
with the result obtained anoche in cartagena , where the señorita atlantic is alzó with the percent and the cetro , the department already sum 14 titles of princess and melina is a to the legion of women vallecaucanas that have state close of the percent but that were proclamas princesas between them of ospina benoit ( give ) , clear domínguez borrero ( 1949 ) , from bellini ayala ( 1979 ) , was fashion ( 1981 ) , rose mary alzate ( 1983 ) , olga maría arenas ( 1987 ) , leila blanque ( 1988 ) , mónica evers ( 1989 ) , maría consuela pinedo ( 1990 ) , diana isabel romero ( 1993 ) , giselle garcés aljure ( 2000 ) , catalina giraldo ( 2007 ) , stephanie garcés aljure ( 2008 ) . 
today the great question that many is do is do what concluded ? 
because the result represents the defeat of a great favorita that in every presentation proved that she had all for be the new señorita colombia , not in vain was is as of the police and better face jolie of vogue , titles that able reinas as taliana vargas or natalia navarro who is were the percent of señorita colombia . 
the first factor that is as key in the decision that took the jury of designarla first princess election in that not convenció with their answer to the question &quot; do what is that book that you has are to you and for what ? made for martín murillo gómez , of the carreta literaria leamos . 
the interrrogante the vallecaucana replied : 
&quot; shall a , i quite in the literature , i that is a way of culturalizarse , definitely i that the book that i espoused of childhood is &quot; the principito &quot; , is a book quite their . 
currently shall &quot; crime and punishment &quot; , is a book of literature universal that all we read ; and today in day i read the book of irene nemirovski , a russian , a book hermosísimo that is out &quot; the ardor of the blood &quot; &quot; . 
a answer that little about first for the term &quot; culturalizarse &quot; and second for not explain of way particular of what way every one of the books that citó the have are . 
but the by the ceremony melina own your relaxed and happy with the result &quot; the universe is sabio is what that has that to . 
and for all the people , for favour read a poquito , &quot; the principito &quot; is a great book &quot; 
between the hipótesis neil is says that to valley the quemó the favoritismo . 
a journalist bogotano insinuó that the be the kotler , the ovacionada and the candidate that is was all the kinds further ( challenge of gastronomía oster , vote the public for the better suit notions , and as mother ) , &quot; that when the celos of the other has , estresó to the as and for that not brilló in the stage &quot; . 
and that is notó in their first presentation in suit of bathing in the a the hilton and their two desfiles in the evening of coronación . 
although in both lució safe , is notó that you missing the force and the certain that the representatives of magdalena and atlantic yes presevo . 
ariel osorio , journalist the programme &quot; as in home &quot; , the channel rcn at that the fact of that melina outside impression princess &quot; less that the candidate that more kinds earns for the contest not is as as &quot; . 
also , valley is was to what last very esquiva with the press , and there is equivocó . 
other hipótesis is that valley not in convince the jury on their interest towards the work social , that is in last , the essence the contest national of beauty . 
for something , two days before of the election the jury international lucy doughty own that them buscaban a woman comprometida with the needs social of their pais . 
&quot; the beauty single not enough in a miss colombia , there that look region beyond of what physical and deal in their sensitivity social , that before of imply the contest are already involucradas in projects &quot; , he . 
also is especula that valley pecó for their flaws in the derriere and the fibrosis that is you notaba in their abdomen , but is planetary therefore precisely the jury the was as the candidate &apos; beauty natural &apos; with the body more healthy , good food and work physical responsible . 
the preparador of reinas borg hernán orozco recognised that melina not had the better body , that had best , &quot; but their problem of fibrosis in the abdomen , that the truth for my not was very notoria , you given points in the last day &quot; . 
between therefore the journalist done hoyos , of the magazine cromos as that the mistake of the vallecaucana were the speeches quirúrgicas that is practicó . 
&quot; the cirugías are well , but valley not is the it to . 
their body never was their strong and here is the cobraron &quot; . 
for this prize , that for first time over the contest national of the beauty , after the raised in suit of bathing about a humane vaticinio that anoche is factors , therefore is said that this was the contentillo that raymundo you concedía to melina for not should the will of the percent . 
reality or not , what true is that melina since today it a year of reinado , not as sovereign , but as princess , position that you there the possibility of represent to colombia in one of the certámenes international for designation the own contest national . 
without however , she will to the history as a of the reinas that to despite of their arrollador step for cartagena , you was esquiva the percent . 
so was the work the caleño that lighthouse the cadáver of alfonso cano 
a lofoscopista of cali happened to the history as the man that this the death of &quot; alfonso cano &quot; . 
the work of these officials is key . 
the last 4 of november a lofoscopista the cti of cali happened to the history as the man that this the identity the maximum head of the farc : &quot; alfonso cano &quot; , to through the cotejo of their fingerprinting digital . 
of the seven lofoscopistas that laboran in the seccional the cti , that week you tocaba the time of &quot; availability &quot; to eliazar gonzález , a man of port tejada that for 21 years working in the area of research legal . 
the an their career , gonzález worked in municipalities the from , where many sometimes had that internarse for more of five days in the jungle for come the get in the that were the bodies that be be at . 
in the 2000 is out to the capital the valley and , then of to the courses appropriate , is especializó in lofoscopia , that is the study of the fur of fricción , is say , of the palmas of the hands and of the feet . 
the week the operational against alias alfonso cano to eliazar you these that on clothes minimum for three days . 
something large you than . 
the friday in the night went for the cauca in a single since palmira . 
was that should identify two bodies and that is sospechaba that one of them was the man that respected to the guerrilla more former the world , for what that you ’ that on the card decadactilar of currently a sáenz ( their real name ) . 
without however , when was with the team of research the get in the that is was the cadáver not what recognised for their aspect physical , therefore was very different the that had seen in the media of communication . 
was without barba , clothing as a plead of the area , without glasses and a more old . 
but the fingerprinting not mienten . 
on of a lupa galtoniana , ink , a transplantador and a linterna , eliazar comparó the from fingerprints the cadáver with the of the card . 
their eye not you falló : was &quot; alfonso cano &quot; . 
that same night , the man oriundo of port tejada was the responsibility of confirmarle the minister of defence , juan charles pinzón , that yes is was the maximum head of the farc . 
in search of the left 
for a dactiloscopista of the sijín of cali the recognition that was the president juan manuel ends to eliazar gonzález , in the wheel of press for the operational against &quot; cano &quot; , is very significant . 
very people not known our work . 
the dactiloscopia is a science accurate , without for of mistake , that can come to be key in the resolution of crimes . 
from of the identification of bodies , the lofoscopistas support research for crimes as hurto and murder and out the identity of the people capturadas . 
when is basis , many criminals have cédulas thinking or not have papers . 
us them we the impression dactilar and the look in the basis of data . 
the scientists romanian that , in a case of hurto , you tocó validity a begin of wall of a home , therefore in that place the do had supported their hand for from a box strong full of joyas and money . 
&quot; the walls are difficult because not are land apropiadas for from a impression dactilar , but in that case we obtain the left of all the hand and identify the criminal , that had participated in different hurtos &quot; , reminded . 
the fingerprinting also can seeking or reaffirm suspected in cases of murder . 
ago little found to a man died , with wise of licor to their around . 
for a of the research is determinó that a family could be suspect the crime and , indeed , a left in the bottleneck coincidía . 
although this not does that has been the murderer , yes what ubica in the scene the crime . 
a dactiloscopista the cti he that in the items &quot; the fingerprinting is sacan with reactivos chemical or physical &quot; . 
when with , is used a transplantador or cut for levantarlas . 
then of this , the from are settlement to the asif , that is the basis of data delincuencial , or to the registraduría . 
&quot; the problem is that still there many end do &quot; , followed the expert the cti . 
aclaró that not all is as is shows in the programme of television csi . 
so as not all what that addis is gold , not all what that is it is again left . 
without however , if can be usada , if is for the cotejo enjoy . 
the &quot; indignados &quot; will to authorities in new york 
hundreds of demonstrators is point to the square zuccotti for acampar . 
a great part atendió the order of desalojo and is out to a paruqe have . 
the those the movement as wall street desafiaron this tuesday to the authorities of new york the treat of into of new , under the under of a order legal , to the square of manhattan of where were desalojados of brave and the treat of should another park of the great manzana . 
hundreds of demonstrators is point to the square zuccotti , where wanted access thank to a order legal that allows to the &quot; indignados &quot; again to acampar in the place , while that other part the movement replied the desalojo in a park more the north of the city , where has there new arrests . 
&quot; our idea is that , if the court not we allows again to acampar in the square , we we to on in some another place and continuaremos the battle legal for again to zuccotti , so as to through of around and demonstrations peaceful &quot; , said one of the for the movement &quot; as wall street &quot; , mark bray . 
bray detalló that the answer of the &quot; indignados &quot; the desalojo of their camp be personally for the mayor of new york , by bloomberg , was to the courts , where the jueza lucy billings issued a order that prohibía the evacuation forzosa the place and did to the demonstrators to in acampados . 
also , the &quot; indignados &quot; procedieron to the occupation of a new park it in the confluencia of the céntricas channel street and the sexta avenida , very close of the entry the tunnel holland , that unite new york and new jersey , and property of the used of trinity church . 
the least for a time overpower should the place , but after the police turned and were to stop to some of the demonstrators , although bray not could confirm the figure concrete , while was to efe that was to several journalists that were also esposados . 
the organisation will that are several hundreds of people the that is had installed in that point , where already is has desplazado a delegation of leaders religious in shows of support to the those the movement and that has treaty of mediar with the police . 
between therefore , the square zuccotti -que is a recinto of property privada- still closed to the expected of the since of a view legal are for this same tuesday in the that is must analyse the legality of the evacuation of this brave . 
some of the demonstrators posting to there portaban and repartían to these hours millions of that order legal and even the entregaban to the players that custodiaban the square , what that resulted &quot; some small clashes &quot; , followed bray , who recently that some official propinaron old to the demonstrators . 
the order legal including to the authorities desalojar to the member of as wall street or implement &quot; laws that is publicaron after of that mismanage the occupation or ban to the demonstrators access of new the park with shops or other properties that were before &quot; . 
the mayor bloomberg followed to the press that , because to that order legal , the city had suspended the reapertura the space the public and to the demonstrators , to the that alerted , without however , that the laws local not them it them to on with shops of campaign and medication of our . 
the regidor for personally the desalojo taken to out of brave of the square zuccotti , a operation in the that is were to around of 200 arrests and that is decided because the demonstrators were &quot; violations the law &quot; . 
bloomberg he that was the order of evacuar the square because this is was becoming &quot; in a place in the that the people not venÍan to protest , but to have the laws and , in some cases , to to damage to other people &quot; , already that &quot; some business habÍan received threats &quot; and the neighbours temÍan &quot; for their quality of life &quot; . 
&quot; the desalojo of this brave was asqueroso and shows that in the fund bloomberg is more interested in preserving the interests financial that the of the workers americans &quot; , added the spokesman the movement , who was the mayor of &quot; faltar the respect to the freedom of expression &quot; . 
the responsible of &quot; as wall street &quot; indicaron also that think organise &quot; large actions &quot; for the thursday in cooperation with organisations community and trade , for commemorate the two months that 15 the protests , that started the 17 of september .

japan renace after the earthquake 
the gdp overall a 1,5 % thank the consumption share and being end to the spiral of caídas that set in march 
since the last month of march the economy macroeconomic is was paralysed , still convaleciente for the devastating earthquake that inhumanity in a crisis nuclear , the worst disaster that padeció the country nipón since the ii war world . 
the first estimates the government of tokio cifraron the losses materials in 300.000 million of dollars , a coup that , despite the difficult context world , seems have atenuado . 
after of three continuation consecutivos of caídas , the fact the product internal gross between july and september was for to indeed , definitely : the gdp is incrementó a 1,5 % in compared with the quarter previous and a 6 % in rate anualizada . 
the reported in the second quarter - for the japanese , the year tax beginning in march of 2012 - is , also , the greater pace of growth since the period of january to march of 2010 . 
the recovery is explains , in part , for the repunte of the buying of machinery for being the areas asoladas for the seísmo and the and tsunami . 
of fact , the companies increased their investment in a 1,1 % , with the rising the 0,9 % in expenditure of capital that is observed of january to march , the first the after of six months of pushed ininterrumpidas . 
without however , the real revulsivo of the economy macroeconomic not is on exclusively in the momentum he that being to take the crisis for strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructure , servirse of the shortcomings for grow since zero . 
japan has monster , on all , thank to the development the consumption share , that in the today represents the 60 % the gdp japonés . 
this one escaló a 1 % , empujada for the increase the expenditure in vehicles , travel and activities of leisure .

tokio is has encomendado the market internal , when the yen - the currency nipona - is has become in one of the &quot; values refuge &quot; escogidos for the investors that fleeing of the crisis of debt in the area euro and the top forecasts of ee.uu. , a privileged that is as a losa in the accounts of the companies exportadoras . 
with a home more strong , the products are more expensive in the abroad , a seriously precisely for a country whose line of flotación economic next certain for the health of the large groups achieved . 
toyota or sony , for example , achacaron their weak results between july and september to the share the yen . 
while the markets are with their asedio to the countries as of the eu , the government of yoshihiko noda not low the call . 
&quot; there that be stress to the risks that reached , as the deterioration of some economies foreign , the impact of the floods of thailand and the fast this the yen &quot; , pointed yesterday the secretary of state of policy economic , motohisa furukawa . 
and , in effect , the prospects not are encouraging . 
the organisation for the cooperation and the development economic ( oecd ) precisó that the majority of the countries member tabled in september signs more nítidos of lies economic . 
the indicator that anticipa the points of ancient in the economy world it of highlighted that the main powers is are frenando . 
already that given four décimas to the 100,4 points , with to the 100,8 of august .

the cdu proposes choose the president european for suffrage universal 
the first day the congress of the union cristiano-demócrata ( cdu ) , the monday 14 of november , in leipzig , has appropriations without large difficulties for telephoned telephoned , chancellor and president the party cristiano-demócrata . 
m not is had including in the order the day the future of europe , but the issue is imposed in autumn , in particular for satisfy to the fighters that they that the policy the government is currently too little strict with the greeks and could become in a future with the italians . 
the motion on the presidency of the commission european , proposal for the direction , is adopted virtually for unanimity . 
of the 1.001 delegates , so only is registered nine votes in against and ten abstenciones . 
the standing ovation of several minutes that is ganaron , with their speeches , telephoned telephoned and , after several hours , wolfgang schäuble , the eurófilo minister of finance , despejan any doubt possible . 
the idea key of the chancellor , and of the motion , is short in a motto : the answer to the crisis &quot; not is least europe , but more europe &quot; . 
not only because europe is the peace , but also because &quot; nine million of jobs on directly the euro &quot; . 
for the chancellor , &quot; has come the time of open way in europe &quot; . 
this could within in amendments the treaty of lisbon for allow strengthen the control of the union european on the policies budgetary of the countries of the area the euro , although also could desembocar in the election the president of the commission european for suffrage universal for &quot; should a face to europe &quot; . 
in all case , that is a of the proposals of the motion adopted for the congress , clearly idea of wolfgang schäuble . 
without doubt , is little likely that the 27 are quickly to a agreement on this change radical : great britain is shows hostile to he and the leaders of the cdu seem know that nicolas his also . 
but the accept is on the ground . 
for another on , the delegates have rejected for a majority result the proposal of ponderar the weight of every country of the directive the bank central european in role the weight of every economy , what which obviously reforzaría the weight of germany . 
ansiosa for calmar the encouraged in the internal of their party , the chancellor has increased the we to konrad adenauer and helmut kohl . but not is that has tried who to their congress to at of the &quot; small &quot; countries european or of the countries in difficulties prepared to criticise to the byword germany . 
although the motion on europe he a paragraph to the importance of &quot; the friendship franco-alemana &quot; , telephoned telephoned not has mentado to france . 
unless of last . 
still that , ago two centuries , is in a bloody battle in leipzig . 
of fact , was a of the derrotas more examinations for the army of rostopchine . 
the impact the fraud in the in for disease 
after the benefits , the ump and the government emprenden a for against the in for disease . 
nicolas his will the tuesday 15 of november in from for visit a box responsible of the benefits family and pronounce a speech on the issue , already recurrent since 2007 , of the fight against the fraud social and the ayudantía . 
also , for her such for , that part of the will of save of way into , but still so reminds to a s of the campaign presidential of right , the majority to deal in the in for disease . 
in first place , for implement cuts budgetary : the government for impose to the workers the sector private a fourth day of we before of power take the low . 
in final , unless that there a convention of company specific , a worker that caiga ill would four days of wage , is say , a minimum the 15 % of their income month . 
is is of a measure that could on a wave of ira , but that would save 280 million of eur , according them echos . 
also , would accompanied of other measure with a reach more symbolic : impose to the officials a day of we without pay in case of low labour ( to the at , not have we , with to the three days that is apply in the sector private ) . 
while is debaten these issues , the majority again to to on the table also the issue the fraud , this time it towards the abuses of the in labour . 
&quot; will to incrementarse significantly the controls and , also , if is which to someone obviously a fraud , must reembolsar the cuantías &quot; , would xavier bertrand about in the rtl the sunday 13 of november . 
the as that in the other cases , the effects the announcement seem slightly desproporcionados for the reality the fraud in on of in labour . 
of fact , since 2002 is for a up constant of this question and is have it various as policies that , normally , have given as . 
the french not enferman more that in the rest of europe . 
look with attention , in first place , the figures national . 
according the institute french of the security social ( cnam ) , in 2006 is abonaron more of 237 million of eur in particular for in labour . 
according the institute french of research and background in economy of the health , the benefits for the in representaron , in 2008 , the 5 % the expenditure health , ascendiendo to 11.300 million of eur . 
of this sum , the 46 % is to the in for leave and for accidents labour , while that the 54 % is related with the in for disease , figure that out to 6.200 million of eur . 
for therefore , the 2,5 % the expenditure in health . 
in 2010 , the french have cogido a average of 14,5 days of low labour , with to 17,8 in 2009 , according a study the group soul consulting . 
a average that , without doubt , behind government : other survey , published in 2007 for the syrian of management professional monster.com , mostraba that the 75 % of the 40.000 workers french encuestados prevent that not had cogido or a only day of low for disease . 
another study , in this case of the assurance maladie , points that in 2010 the 37 % of the in for disease had a term than to 8 days , the 22 % of between 8 and 14 days , the 15 % of between 15 days and a month , the 15 % of between one and three months and the 11 % were more result . 
if the compared with our neighbours european , the workers french not are more propensos that in other areas to take in for disease . 
a long study done in 2010 for two researchers the cnrs planning that , between 1994 and 2001 , the rate of lack global the work ( therefore for reasons of health as of another kind ) oscilaba , in france , between the 10 % and the 11 % , with to a 20 % and a 28 % in denmark , a 15 % in kingdom united or between a 16 % and a 18 % in the countries netherlands . 
the fraud in the in for disease not is especially significant in compared with the work not of . 
the fraud has a reach quite limited . 
the forward of the legislation , since 2002 , has caused that the controls of the in for disease of more of 45 days are sistemáticos . 
in 2008 , of 1,5 million of inspections , the cnam comprobó , in a 13 % of the 285.000 by , that the in of short term were &quot; unacceptable or too we &quot; , is say , 37.050 cases . 
in the case of the in of more of 45 days , further to inspections sistemáticas , is was that the 11 % of the cases were &quot; rightly adaptados or injustificados ; a figure that , taking as starting a total of 1,2 million , out to 132.000 . 
for therefore , is high a total of 169.000 cases &quot; injustificados &quot; between several million of workers that cogieron a low for disease . 
without doubt , a figure if in compared , for example , with the work in black . 
according the member of the ump dominique tian , author of a report on this question in june , this practice will a losses of income tax of between 9.000 and 15.000 million of eur the year , is say , more that the cost total of the benefits for in and , without doubt , significantly more that the fraud in this last area .

policy energy : 
the facts must assert more that the undistorted 
if there a issue that not is can treat taking in account considerations of short term or simply thinking in the emotion , is the policy energy . 
the availability and the cost of the electricity have directly in the power purchasing and in the competitiveness of the companies . 
is appropriate that a i electoral be the at of think on such issues and on the place of the energy nuclear . 
the debate only will useful if strengthening the whole of the consequences economic , social and environmental of the options proposals . 
the french must existing their opinion in facts objectives , in data goodness . 
now that we 7.000 million of people in the planet , the development demographic some the lead of the demand we before of 2050 , to least that is prive to a huge part of the population world of a element vital . 
the same time , will that reverse the shortage every time greater of the resources tempo for to have electricity continually , without forget the imperiosa need of reduce the emissions of gases of effect greenhouse for fight against the change climate , a issue that has disappeared the debate ecological . 
the accident of fukushima not change none of these parameters . 
for that , germany it single in their decision of up to the energy nuclear . 
that not is the case or of belgium , that hearing the their to the need of find a source capable of sustituirla , or of switzerland , that only has for aim build central of last generation . 
for another on , great britain , finland , poland , republic czech , countries netherlands , sweden , africa , china , india and brazil , for quote some examples , are forward with determination with their projects . 
the states united , for their on , after fukushima you add a unit to their park , retomando the construction of a central interrumpida after the accident of three mile island . 
if the model german , based in the energy renewable , is is in times as example , the reality is in against of such speech . 
the election of berlin is to mean a encarecimiento the price of the electricity , a greater on energy for the need incrementada of gas imported , in particular of russia , a increase of the emissions of co2 for the construction of central of gas and of coal . 
in a months , is notarán the effects harmful . 
must meditarse on the case of denmark . 
campeón of europe in the sector eólico , the which this the 30 % of their electricity , also is one of the large users of coal and of gas because to the intermitencia the wind ; for this reason , their emissions of co2 and the price of their electricity are , respectively , a 65 % and a 50 % more high that the average european . 
for the contrary , thank to the have of our policy energy , our neighbours abonan a they of electricity a 40 % higher to the of the who french . 
while that in a economy restructurings the cost of the energy is a factor key of the competitiveness and a guarantee the peacekeeping of the usefulness industrial in the territory national , the companies french is benefit of the electricity more cheap of europe . 
for that reason , any reduction significantly of the energy nuclear would a strong said the price of the electricity , what that restaría realism to the maravillosas statements on the reindustrialización of our country and the defence of our power purchasing . 
is is of a price that the great majority of the french is refuse to pay and , of fact , not manifiestan opposition for principle to that kind of energy , according show the surveys . 
remember that the policy energy of our country has lost build a sector industrial with 125.000 jobs of work director and 410.000 jobs indirectos . 
widely it to the export , encompasses a galaxy of pymes specialist in the markets international and that can create jobs not deslocalizables . 
if france decidiese leave the energy nuclear , would the sacrificio of great part of these smes and the loss of the 6.000 million of eur year in exports french of equipment and services nuclear . 
do what electricista encargaría a epr designed for work sixty years , when is to the collapse of their manufacturer ? 
for as the equation of the energy nuclear , there that admit that not there a source miracle of production of electricity , the as that not there a source diabólica . 
the development for part of areva of solutions with in emissions of co2 , nuclear and renewable , shows the nature provide of the sources of energy . 
in the case of the energy nuclear , is essential keep the maximum level of security . 
in france , we of a authority of security that has a control at and transparent therefore on the central existing as on the construction of flamanville . 
our equipment , of recognised professionalism , are also medium for the security . 
in a century , the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious . 
so only one , the of three mile island , is in in a conditions operational normal ; not resulted consequences or for the people or for the a environment . 
in chernobyl , the accident is was the design the into and to a failures human imperdonables . 
in fukushima , some people seem forget that the accident is was to two disasters natural of a reach without unprecedented , that obviously the death of tens of thousands of people . 
the sector nuclear aprenderá of this accident , such as what was of the two previous . 
thank to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security , and the operators and seating french and germans , the epr is a design capable of resistir to such phenomena . 
while what estudian all the players bring that want build a central , the interruption of their construction in flamanville would a great gift for the competitors of areva and edf , since that them through to free for in the leadership in the inevitable development the sector nuclear . 
is essential and legitimate to the best options energéticas for our country , but would irresponsible to that the emotion , the undistorted and the refer partisanas dominasen a debate so important for the situation economic , social and financial of our country . 
the immigration , do a burden or a opportunity for the economy ? 
the policy of immigration it for nicolas his has been criticada on since various points of view : the saturación of the services police , judicial and administrative subject to the policy of figures , the where of this policy with the statute autoproclamado of &quot; country of the rights human &quot; of france . 
more recently , is the harassment administrative of the students foreign the that has saltado to the headlines , with the minister of internal ( véase the newspaper libération the 23 of may ) proclamando of last that france &quot; not needs talentos foreign , workers or camareros &quot; . 
without however , rarely time is analysing since the point of view economic . 
the question is that , on this issue , there quite consensus between the left and the right . 
in the case of the right , jacques chirac fijó the of declarando in 1976 that &quot; 900.000 unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with close of two million of workers immigrants &quot; , while that in the left , the tone what fijó michel indeed explicando that france &quot; not can done office of all the misery the world &quot; in 1990 . 
the only difference , the degree of generosity 
in 2005 , therefore the left as the right compartían the fear to the invasion the territory national for a a of fontaneros poles . 
to both both , is as that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society french . 
the only difference is in the degree of generosity with the that act with on to the immigrants . 
in their programme , mitterrand hollande is limited to include banalidades , those that the codesarrollo will as the &quot; problem of the migration &quot; . 
this idea of the immigration as a burden , a problem , perhaps is why electoralmente , but economically its very face . 
such as guarding the economists shoulder goldin and geoffrey saying in a labour recent that sums the knowledge more recent on the immigration ( exceptional people : how migration shaped our world and will it our future , may of 2011 , princeton university associated , 352 pp . ) , there a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive of the flows migratory in the growth economic , the wages and the employment in the countries that they immigrants . 
the that of the immigration in the growth and it the employment . 
the fears related with the impact of the immigrants is based in the idea of that these can replace to the workers national , in particular to the little would , hard for that is reduce their wages . 
but the experience shows that , in reality , the immigrants are more well additional that substitutes of the workers national and who mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment . 
the immigrants little would working in sectors that not by to workers national and the more would in sectors enjoy where the training not is the demand of personal . 
a effect positive on the wages 
the same way that a vladmir would difficulties for work in a country that have lack of anestesistas , the complementariedad between national and immigrants from that the arrival of these last there welcome in the wages and the employment of the national . 
taking in account what previous , giovanni peri calculó that a increase the 1 % of the flows migratory is a said of the wages real to long term of between a 0,6 and a 0,9 % . 
and , without have in account the fact of that the diversity that aportan the immigrants not to the creation of ideas and the growth economic ( there a great proportion of kinds nobel americans naturalizados and companies as google , intel , paypal , ebay and yahoo were suspicions for immigrants ) . 
the immigrants also are taxpayers their to the systems social , since that aportan of average a 1 % the budget total in the countries european . 
the organisation international the work estimated , for example , that in germany a immigrant that it with a age of 30 years moreover a contribution neta ( income least expenditure ) of 150.000 eur to the budgets public of average for all their life . 
the principle of their mandate , nicolas his wanted go to to the points of growth that you faltaban &quot; with the will &quot; . 
these will , that disuadieron to the immigrants , had exactly the effect horrific . 
europe invented the democracy , only you lack think in a democracy european 
the democracy is a well precious , but also fragile . 
the continent european should power acordarse of this already that , although is invented in athens ago more of two billion years , to what long the century 20th has suffered the tragedies of the war world , totalitarismos , the holocaust , the had , but also to very in spain , to salazar in portugal , the coroneles in greece . 
some perhaps up that , for that the democracy triunfase definitely on their enemies , would enough exercise the vote and the way more direct possible . 
we , since rostopchine &quot; the small &quot; , that is was of something thought . 
the suffrage universal , although is is of a condition necessary for the democracy , not is enough for yes only and even can become in a &quot; instrument of oppression &quot; , as said used the filósofo republicano etienne vacherot . 
not , the democracy required a more : a space public , a spirit public , values , a organisation , a separation and a control of the powers , a education , go , solidarity economic and social , justice . 
the crisis that we in europe is a crisis economic , but is to point of become in a crisis policy and democratic . 
the palinodia the referendum greek verdadero-falso had , to this on , a double effect intend : was the need of a return take of the sphere policy , but also the worrying that of their unable , of their huge . 
must reflexionarse on this ambivalence for superarla . 
the truth is that the lines the with of the battle democratic currently is have desplazado and that , in many cases , the soldiers republican already not progress in the good sense . 
not saldremos gaining if we a way of referenda national , organised in role of the needs and of way desordenada . 
a signing in white the monarca european at or a high the vacuum the hole nacionalista : is what options for the citizen ! 
not , not we from old of effect , but a exercise common , of plenary right , has and we , of the options and the democracy , this time to scale european . 
not there crisis in greece , italy , spain , portugal ( of fact , not sabríamos where end the list ) , because only there a crisis , the crisis of europe . 
the entire of europe is the that is pliega to the issued of the markets and of the agencies of opinion , that the that unaccompanied their powerlessness and their lack of solidarity . 
is the whole of europe the that suffering a humiliation in the sphere international . 
we far for the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but is all europe the that lose slowly the sovereignty and , with she , every a of their nations . 
what more urgent is that the sovereignty popular ’ the there the project european . 
because only together will the european reduce the weight of their debts , shake of the markets and preparing their future by the investment . 
the exit of the crisis multi decisions to scale european that not will issue without a legitimacy democratic total , unless that be for conducirnos the disaster . 
after have fought for a time against this proposal of the socialists and of jacques delors , all the world for in the today a governance economic european . 
that so be . 
but think in she without a greater integration policy and democratic , and without that be vivida as such for the citizens , would a new madness and we would to a new point died . 
we in a new stage of the construction european . 
for build the republic in france , was be &quot; to &quot; republican . 
the revolution motivated for interests not would enough . 
this lesson still being applies . 
we build a europe more integrated since the point of view economic . 
only is will achieve build a europe more democratic in the level political , a real sovereignty popular european . 
for build europe , us european . 
the cards with chip &quot; without contact &quot; is generalizan 
the secondly world of the cards of chip is as the tuesday in villepinte , close of paris , with a environment set . 
of fact , the year 2011 should by with a increase the 11 % in the sales world of cards with microprocesadores ( cards bank , mobile with cards sim , etc. ) , with a total of 6.000 million of units , according are the gabinete eurosmart .

around of 26 million of cards bank visa already have of this role , that is on in 75.000 terminals of payment . 
in france , their beginning are more modest : is are being 400.000 cards visa without contact . 
but the large land working for four . 
carrefour has we this year 2,5 million of cards pass mastercard without contact . 
for get the into higher , not however , is necessary that the banks the me to available of their customers . 
&quot; there two large financial french that is have committed to essential systematically in the future , between their customers , cards bank dotadas the system without contact &quot; , is gérard nébouy , director general of visa europe france . 
the banks proves the payment for telephone mobile 
but so only is a first stage towards the a of payment the future : the telephone mobile . 
in the today , there few equipment equipados with the technology nfc ( near sole communication ) , essential for to the transactions . 
&quot; is are rezagando &quot; . 
&quot; but should for end shares a real on the year that next &quot; . 
&quot; prevemos that is venderán between 80 and 120 million of units in 2012 in all the world &quot; , explains marc bertin , president of eurosmart . 
but the banks take the delantera . 
the bank crédit agricole announced yesterday the launching of a test between december and the next june in give . 
is equiparán the iphone of around of 200 customers and colleagues with a funda that allows the payment without contact .

the heard to nigeria , the with terrorist is in increase 
paris is concerned for the links between the al in the magreb islamic and the secta boko haram . 
the links between the group terrorist the al in the magreb islamic ( aqmi ) and the secta can of boko haram , on the that is sospechaba since ago time , is have confirmed . 
the sunday , the viceministro argelino of affairs foreign , abdelkader messahel , even stated that argel already &quot; has the certidumbre &quot; . 
&quot; the way in that both organisations operating and the reports of the services of intelligence shown that are cooperando &quot; , he , without to more details . 
paris seems come to a conclusion similar . 
the research on the previously of two french in huge the last january would indicated the pasarelas . 
raptados in a written of niamey for people related with aqmi , antoine of léocour and vincent delory died the day next together with several of their secuestradores for a operation replaces for the forces special french . 
in the rubble of the intervention , the researchers french and into as several chips telefónicos that been to the terrorists . 
s terrorist 
the study of the called made points towards several partners based in mali , huge and nigeria . 
according radio france internationale ( rfi ) , two numbers captaron especially the interest of the researchers : one leads to a nigeriano that permaneció for a time in maiduguri , a city the north of nigeria , cradle of boko haram , and the another to a man that , supposed , is have to aqmi and to the secta . 
&quot; is is of a progress , but without doubt we wait to poseer evidence more formal before of about of cooperation operational between aqmi and boko haram &quot; . 
&quot; but is possible &quot; . 
&quot; we since ago years that the secta have of support financial and intellectual foreign and that every time is more active &quot; , says kunle amuwo , a scientists nigeriano . 
these last months , these &quot; support &quot; had result every time more clear in the development and the speeches of boko haram or in their any operational , that now far the use of kamikazes or equipment explosives every time more complex and the same lifestyle that the category for aqmi . 
the community international , beginning for washington , is since then hard to abuya for that have in account the problems have for boko haram . 
the authorities hopes , of fact , have time recital the group as a community of iluminados little arts of interest . 
a success quickly 
up in 2002 in maiduguri in about to a mezquita , a school and the wanting fundamentalista rapid yusuf , boko haram ( that means , in hausa , &quot; the education western is a pecado &quot; ) , spreading to the both of a emirato islamic in the north muslim of nigeria . 
in this region poor , the partnership is living a success quickly . 
is politiza and requires a respect at of the sharia , while that their fighters is within to the fight against the government central impío . 
these last is orientan in first place to the churches , the sofas , the administrations . 
in 2009 , the fighters of boko haram were especially active and is multiplicaron the attacks against the comisarías . 
the reaction of abuya was , as is to , widespread . 
the army atacó the city and is registered 800 dead . 
rapid yusuf , he in life , a the death in prison . 
since then , the secta is radicaliza and or their feudos the north . 
the past their , eye a attack that cause 80 dead in jos and , after , another in abuya . 
in june , boko haram again to attack against abuya , in particular against the guardia general protected of the police , with a attack suicidal , the first of this kind . 
in august , the based local of the nations un is becomes in their first aim international . 
the creation of a s terrorist in africa , that abarcaría since mauritania to somalia and for nigeria , concerned to all the specialists of the security . 
while that aqmi has establish mali and huge and that the nasteh of al-chebab operating in kenya , boko haram from as a new threat in the centre the continent . 
the week last , for a meeting in nigeria with the president goodluck jonathan , alain juppé you has people against boko haram and has apos that was prepared to &quot; share all the information &quot; . 
the world according the candidates republican to the presidency 
in relationship with china , with iran and with the aid to israel , mitt romney , herman cain , and rick perry conclude in simpleza and lack of knowledge . 
a america debilitada for the crisis , do can home a world complex with ideas simple or , even , simplistas ? 
enjoy to the candidates republican for the presidential , the electorate could think that so is . 
since ago a days , mitt romney , herman cain , rick perry and the other candidates every time do more statements estruendosas and atajos in on of policy foreign , traditionally a point strong of the republican . 
is extienden the lemas , to often infundamentados , on china , iran , the aid to israel . 
mitt romney , the candidate better it in the career towards the designation for the &quot; cardiff old party &quot; , has threatened with to to the chinese to the wto and denunciarles &quot; for manipulation of their home &quot; , a issue key in a america exasperada for the migration of fragmentos entire of their sector towards asia . 
does as if that means the explosion of a war trade , stated . 
jon huntsman , former ambassador of obama in china and the only candidate that has a vision sofisticada of the policy foreign , almost is ahoga to a attitude that &quot; apabulla &quot; the emotion . 
has asked a dialogue firm , but parity , with beijing ( the position current of obama ) . 
but huntsman , that is is plateau in the bottom of the polls , still being inaudible . 
the lifestyle of reagan 
romney also has promised a intervention military in iran if the sanctions not among who their programme nuclear . 
&quot; if salgo elected , detendré to iran &quot; , fanfarroneó . 
&quot; if obama its for , will the bomb &quot; . 
promised also increase the aid military to israel , acusando to obama of have failed with their obligations in relationship with that partner . 
the his herman cain , the second candidate better mainly , shows for their part a lack embarrassing of such subjects . 
recently , instaba to to to the threat military china because beijing &quot; is develop capacity nuclear &quot; , apparently her the fact of that china already at the átomo military since 1964 . 
the governor tejano rick perry , that supports to israel and to intervene in iran , says that , for their part , is prepared to set the army us in mexico for fight against the which of the drugs . 
the appeal to the torture against the supposed terrorists , ban for obama in 2009 , also what preconizan cain , perry and the candidate michele bachmann . 
the differences are considerable with the candidate republicano of 2008 , john mccain , a weight heavy in policy foreign . 
the opponents the current president contestan that reagan also had ideas simple and that won the war cold . 
reminiscent that the own obama was a amateur and that had that aflojar the engine in on of fight against the terrorism . 
insisten , with reason , in the failure of their ingenuo dialogue with iran , in the exit hurried of the &quot; boys &quot; of iraq and in their tergiversaciones in libya , and what etiquetan of weak . 
but the attacks not them are simple . 
the population juzga of a way more well positive the balance of security national of obama , that over with bin bin . 
since iraq , desconfía of the speeches military that beautiful a hundimiento . 
and , argumentando that ago lack rebuild economically america for begun their leadership , obama does the impression of be more fair . 
the nord stream , new door of entry the gas russian in europe 
the pipeline nord stream , that comunica directly europe western with russia and for the fund the sea baltic , already is has since in service . 
must supply gas for satisfy the needs of thirty million of who . 
gazprom , the giant russian the gas , has wanted so the event with great pompa . 
the last tuesday , more of 500 invited , including four heads of state and of government , took to on the baltic , between the music of the orquesta and a delicate bufet , in the opening the nord stream , the new pipeline that comunica directly , under the sea , russia with germany . 
symbolically , the chancellor german telephoned telephoned , the president russian dmitri indication , the first minister french mitterrand fillon and their counterpart of the countries netherlands , mark rutte , have girado together the volante of the válvula that controls the entry of gas russian in the network of europe western . 
with this new pipeline , every year that 27,5 million of metres runs of gas russian additional to europe western to through of a first had of 1.224 km that comunican the region of st petersburg with the land of mecklemburgo-pomerania . 
a second tubo should concluirse to end of 2012 that will supply a total of 55.000 million of metres runs of gas , is say , enough for cover all the consumption french . 
also , already is about of the possibility of build a third tubo for the same way . 
for gazprom , the completion to time of this huge labour is buenos of victory . 
poland and the countries baltic is had there strongly the project . 
of fact , the nord stream is to allow supply gas directly to germany , any the course earth for third countries ( poland and ukraine ) . 
of coup , these two countries some something of their power : for them , will more difficult influence in russia amenazándola with cerrarle the access to the markets of europe western . 
in the point álgido the debate , warsaw not dudó in for the nord stream as a &quot; new pact germano-soviético &quot; , in reference to the alliance between hitler and stalin for should poland in 1939 . 
is say , if the issue is politically delicate . 
europe western , support the project russian , has obtained a greater security of supply . 
but the price is a weakening of the europe of the energy , given that the project has led a gap between the european the this and the west . 
russia has known , in so only five years , to triunfar their vision of a alliance direct between russia and the countries western rich , large consumers of gas and with a reserves every time more limited . 
&quot; this pipeline is a component of our partnership with russia , a new arteria that we unite of way conventional &quot; , this mitterrand fillon for the opening the pipeline , proving to what point the large contracts the sector the gas are so political as economic . 
all this explains the reaching smiles in the coin of the that of gazprom , many in lubmin , in the point of arrival the gas . 
the construction of this pipeline also is a achievement technical . 
the tubo submarino is made of steel recubierto of rebuild for protegerlo against the anclas of the ships . 
is supports in the fund the sea , to a average of 200 concluded of depth . 
for construirlo , was necessary avoid camps of mines that ponds of the second war world . 
&quot; was necessary with or destroy a centena of them , for caution &quot; , out jens müller , spokesman of the society nord stream . 
also , was necessary providing the measures of protection of the as and the flora . 
the tubo is a long about of metal that is as 242 torres eiffel and not is cut in all their length : or for válvulas , or for stations of peacekeeping . 
was are a platform of control in the water of sweden , but the responsible the project renunciaron to the same the see that the swedish not were very prepared to allow that a society state russian is estableciera of way permanent in the sea with to their coast . 
&quot; in case of avería , interrumpiremos the step the gas in least of a minute &quot; , precise jens müller . 
in case of flight , the gas the pipeline is liberará , for therefore , to the atmosphere . 
but the seating they little likely that is would a flight , since that have to junturas that , according the forecasts , will a flight every 100.000 years . 
the control the state the pipeline is does by a control submarino , arrastrado for a per , that for inspections foreign , so as by a has that everything for the internal the pipeline . 
with the way of a pure , is kind in the internal the tubo , that has a distance of a metre , and is all with the gas . 
to their arrival , after three hours minutes of journey to a speed of three metres for second , except data precise on possible deformaciones the metal . 
the pipeline has been designed for work for fifty years without need of no kind of reparación . 
the movement the gas is does simply for the pressure . 
the principle is of 200 bars and , to the exit of 100 bars . 
five companies have united their forces for power to to out this project . 
the company leader is gazprom , that has the 51 % of the participating . 
to she , is unieron the german e.on and basf ( 15,5 % every a ) , so as the among gasunie and the group french gdf suez ( 9 % every one ) . 
these five societies have created a company common , called nord stream , is of build and exploiting the pipeline . 
has their based in zoug , switzerland , where the taxation is especially favourable . 
after , gazprom alquiló to this society , for a term of five years renewable , the entire of the capacities of transport of gas . 
&quot; to gazprom you in for the capacity total , regardless of the amount of gas that really is transport &quot; , precise jens müller . 
the funding of the construction the pipeline is has taken i in a 30 % with the contribution of the accionistas and in a 70 % by loans banking . 
the cost total of the labour should achieve 7.400 million of eur for the two tubos . 
for gdf suez , for example , the investment has reached the 240 million . 
but the accionistas minorities are insurance of that not superarán their investment , since that gazprom here for yes only the risk of the expenditure . 
the pipeline emerge the baltic in lubmin , in a at arenosa plantada of pinos . 
a válvulas , with 4,5 metres of at , are the door of exit the gas . 
there a sensors that miden the pressure , the temperature and the characteristics specific the gas to the arrival , before of that is owed to the pipelines germans . 
since the last tuesday , the terminal a a million of metres runs of gas russian every time . 
to total capacity , will three million for time and in 2012 , six million .

portugal shows very confidence 
the portugal of paulo bento is faces with a great optimism the party of back against bosnia ( 22h00 ) , that is will the tuesday in lisbon . 
in the party of proposed , them missing realism to both equipment . 
&quot; when transcurran these 90 minutes , be a team happy and , on all , a country happy &quot; . 
paulo bento already is is in poland and in ukraine . 
not has no doubt ; the selecçao , that at since september of 2010 , is to cualificarse for the championship of 2012 . 
indeed , so only 90 minutes an to portugal of the Škottová . 
but there a party that play and a relation , bosnia , that defeat . 
taking in account the party of proposed ( 0-0 ) , the friday in the hell of zenica , seems clear that the thing not is my . 
portugal knock the party for more of a time , yes , but not could usher the far gol that you would given the peace . 
&quot; is a good result , but to the time means a risk , since that not we are outside of home &quot; . 
but in home , in the celebrity on of the light of lisbon , the portuguese are much of that pasarán , to a public that should be as of too , even if is clear that the party &quot; is very worldwide &quot; , dixit a bento set but lúcido . 
&quot; we that the party is very worldwide , but we completely much of that we take the delantera &quot; , declared the you portuguese of 42 years . 
&quot; we taking a 50 % of for of participate in the championship 2012 &quot; , has , not however , relativizado the successor of charles queiroz . 
the draw the friday in bosnia forced to the portuguese to usher and to win . 
to the bosnios them could come a draw , although also have need of usher . 
&quot; is a good result , but to the time means a risk , since that not we are outside of home &quot; , regrets bento . 
&quot; we to play against a team that has a great quality technical and that at of players with a great quality individual &quot; , added . 
the as that in zenica , the portuguese iran with the intention of exercise , since the principle , a pressure took on the bosnios for &quot; not reasons time to think &quot; . 
a good idea , always that , this time , be realistic .
