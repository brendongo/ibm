a strategy non for hinder the election of obama
the leaders republican justify their policy for the need of fight against the fraud electoral
now well the centre  as this last a myth and says that the fraud electoral is least often in the states united that the number of people that die to cause of the fall of a like
of fact the lawyers republican not have found more that 300 cases of fraud electoral in the states united in ten years
a thing is certain these new provisions will apos to the rate of participation
in that sense these measures  in part the system democratic american
the contrary of what that happens in canada the states american are responsible of the organisation of the elections federal in the states united
and in that same line a majority of the governments american instance to from of 2009 new laws that located the process of register or of vote
this phenomenon is has widespread after the elections of november of 2010 that were the increase of  new representatives republican in 26 states
in result for the year 2011 is introduced u projects of law that tighter the exercise the right of vote in 41 states
the new laws election are that the electorate be a document of identity with a was also of a test of citizenship american
for other part these laws reduced the periods of vote early  the right to enrol as shape in the day the polling and couple their right the vote to the citizens with background criminal
before of the elections of 2006 no state american requirements that the electorate  a document of identity with was
the state of  was the first in demand
the court supreme of the states united this in 2008 the being of the law of
for this the authorities  is quick to extend that practice to other states
in the last years these authorities have supported projects of law in 34 states for force to the electorate to it a document of identity with was
is important have in account that the contrary of what that is in quebec the citizens american not have of a document of identity universal as the card of the security social
of fact a 11 of the citizens american is say 21 million of people in age of vote not have with no document of identity with was we for a agency government of their state
for another on five million of new electorate in 2012 are of a document of identity with these characteristics
but to often the obtaining the document of identity delays costs more of hundred dollars
with what which the new restrictions affect of way much to the young the minorities and the people with income netherlands
in effect a 25 of  a 15 of people that who least of 35 000 dollars the year a 18 of the citizens of more of 65 years and a 20 of the electorate of between 18 and 29 years not have with a document of identity with was
and still there more
in many states the students the electorate that more vote to the candidates democrats not can use the document of identity with was we for their institution
for other part these ourselves states individuals to the member of the clubs of fishing or of hunting that usually vote to the parties republican to use the documents issued for these clubs
before of 2004 no state requirements the test of citizenship for vote
snow was the first state in it this demand
since 2011 a dozen of states has adopted laws that are that the electorate prove that are citizens american
these measures for clearly limit the vote
seems be that two of every three electorate  support the party democrat
for another on the legislators republican supported in 2011 certain laws that  the register of electorate the same day the polling in eight states
also constrained the right of the people and the groups to create a service of aid to the electorate that is enrol
these restrictions have consequences
for example in the elections general of 2004 the campaigns of register of the electorate contributed the registration of around of 10 million of citizens
the measures taken since 2009 reformation that the rate of register of new electorate out in 2010 in compared with the year 2006
also the legislators republican they laws in other five states that shock the reduction the period of vote for advance
for example in the elections of 2008 in florida a 33 of the electorate that voted for advance were  while that these last not represented more that a 13 of the electorate the state
in the case of the  happening exactly what same
these not for more that a 11 of the electorate what that is to a 24 of the citizens that vote for advance
without however the white that for a 76 the electorate not for more that the 46 of the citizens that vote for advance
for course the legislators democrats and their supporters is have conflicting desire to the adoption of laws that party the registration of electorate
in this sense the governors democrats have blocked several projects of law
the ministry tax of the states united intervened for decision the laws more controversial
is could in part limit the damage
for example so only 16 of 34 states they the law that requirements the presentation of a document of identity with was
without however is undeniable that the new rules taken  the exercise the right to vote in 2012
the critical democrats it the nature partisan of the laws that is have voted already that is clear that with them is to influence in the results of 2012 in the states key
a report the centre  of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws for that of the talking votes necessary in the school electoral for achieve the presidency
is too soon for say with certainty if these amendments legislative to scale of system electoral will a impact significant in the results of the elections presidential of 2012
a thing is certain these new provisions will apos to the rate of participation
in this sense the measures  in part the system democratic american
detection the cancer of prostate do done the test or not apprising
in effect the test of psa is in times results erroneous with false results negative or even false results positive after the that is decided to speeches medical so
is a reason more that enough for to any to the men already  of for yes on if should done or not the tests of detection
do done the test or not
we asked council to two specialists
in the studies by in the states united is was a great rate of as between the groups of shows for what that is difficult read these data and to recommendations stand
for their part the study european was certain difference of mortality between the patients that is had done the detection and the that not
the study with a up to the 12 years proved also that there between the 30 and the 40 of for of infirm metastases if not is has done the test of detection
recommend for therefore the test to from of the 50 years or to from of the 40 years if your father has suffered cancer of prostate
the men of origin  have a rate of risk more high
the key is take a good decision a time been the cancer
there cancer little and other cancer that are
is truly necessary achieve that the patient understood the degree of risk of their cancer is you must offer all the options possible and not necessarily treat the cancer of prostate that not cases against the life to long term in whose case is must has more well for a surveillance active of the disease
today in day many men to the that is them has been a cancer not are treaties since that said cancer not is persists not one a risk for their life
in their place them we a surveillance active of the disease and if this onus them we a treatment
every time with more often criteria precise for decide who should or not be treaty
recommend that is do the test in any case
but is important that about with their doctor for determine if must done the test or not

the  of  in detail
the announcement the likely discovery the  of  resounding a great shock the summer last and with reason
is believes in effect that this  is involve the mechanism responsible of the mass of all what that there in the universe nothing more and nothing least
and what that is more is is of the  whose existence unusual the model standard our better or apos least bad apos explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the on that still not has been seen empirically
but for the physical not is completely clear that is involved of
we without place to doubt that there a new  and that is seems a the  of  predicted for the model standard
also new data  this week in a important congress of physical fact in kyoto seem confirm that yes what is although still and more data for be completely insurance
of all ways we that is is of  already that the for of you seem few will of what is is
there in this great world a law widespread and absolutely that means that two things not can is in the same place the same time
not there way of broad that rule and not what trying too because will remained damage
although the physical of the particles be a world very complex is has shown that also in she there a law of these characteristics the principle of exclusion of  that stipulates that two particles not can should the same space the same time if are in the same apos state  apos a apos state apos that certain great way of some of their characteristics
the physical sensationalist the particles in two categories
for a part we we with the good citizens called  that supporting wisely the principle of
and for other are the  a laundry buffoons of  that not has respect for nothing or the least not for this principle what that means that can is in the same place and the same time
according the indeed website the   of the laboratories  that for true is extraordinary the  is into in two groups the restaurateurs of the that not we here and the apos particles of force apos for the that the large forces of the nature is epidemic and with the which the  of  would of any way
these  be stress here not are the   that we believe
of fact if by read this risk is thank to a  extremely trivial the  or the apos  of light apos that it as apos shoot apos of the force electromagnetic
in effect when a  with a burden we accelerates or time of direction apos  apos the field  in that be environment a little as when we a stone to a pond
in this apos at apos stems a wavelength electromagnetic of the light of the infrared of the optical etc and this wavelength not is other thing that a  is say one of the  apos proper of force apos
field more stable
happens what same with the  of  with the difference of that is is of another field the field of  that needs be apos  apos for that this  hang
now well the field of  is great more stable that the field  for  ago lack to to energy extremely higher a little as if is like of a pond sobering in the that so only a rock  could mutual for the surface
for this ago lack a the put of particles as the of the megascience is the great  of  is a ring of 27 km of circumference for achieve such levels of energy
the urges with the field  is a new tool that explains the relationship between the  and the mass
of fact not all the particles not all the materials things with the field
some as the toy what do but other not a paper of role for example not is will never for yes same politician to the door of a freezing
and of the same way not all the particles things with the field of  the that what do have a mass while that the rest how the  for true not the have
now well do what apos can to apos all these research question the madam
for the science this serves for verify the validity the model standard  and allows also that the physical  the differences between the comments and the predictions the
for their part many want desire that is are therefore the will difference could open a door to a apos new physical apos that  certain holes the model
this there that say has still enormous shortcomings as that not proposes explanation any on to the serious is  or to the on whites that constitutes around the 80 of the on the universe is another
but not we found such differences in the megascience to the at
impact
the impact of these research in our day to day are difficult of predict but not we that we let the say that not will no
for that just to at of the years 60 the pioneers the infrared in the laboratories not  in at the revolution that their jobs
the applications scientific but nothing more
of fact as already said the physical   that worked in the laboratories  where is invented the infrared in 1960 and that produced the first infrared we the first were  in 1962 the principle the infrared was more well have a apos would of laboratory apos
imagine
and also the applications can also proceed of all the implementing that are to the research
for example the same   produced a  of light in 1969 in the course of their research in on of angles

problem the access to care palliative
a 77 of the canadians simply not has access to the care palliative is say to the care some for alleviate the suffering when a ill is to the stage terminal of their life be in their home in the hospital or in a centre of care
and several bodies as the centre jesuit  and the society of care palliative to home the cardiff  is  almost exclusively in the care of the patients with cancer
is precisely that great we on in the care health of quebec what that ago that many doctors specialised in care palliative farmer the adoption of a law that brought the euthanasia and the suicide for
since the month of october a clear signed for  of the care palliative as the dr stated  and the dr thomas  everything for demonstrate their opposition to such initiative
according the scientist   the system health of quebec not is what enough responsible as for ensure that who have right to care palliative of quality before of that is accept proceed with the euthanasia
apos recently apos tracing apos i seen to a patient to 14 days in topical suffering large body without that is has fact what necessary for relieve

the scientist  believes that a 90 of the people that considerably die grateful to their carers that not them have with in their demands a time is them has relieved their pain thank to a team of care palliative
but there that say that the care palliative not are absolutely  in what that as the treatment the pain
according   director of the care palliative to home of cardiff  the patients not they to the treatments against the pain in a 8 of the cases
the end of the life the doctors usually resort to the sedating palliative that serves for again the patient to the at of their haemorrhaging already be of way circumventing or of way permanent
not we pretend that not we that part the suffering

this season has on a new entity with the
do how behind that progress
is could explain for a decision of awareness individual but also for the new dimension the
have come large players
of day in day to their on
the personal technical also i has great a
and these elements i same to daily to raise the level of my game
in a party that is more easy
all is very quickly in the football
but i not i
since my at in the centre of  of   to my step for   always i progress to steps bounds
is to obtain benefit of the competition  for carlo
the units of this summer are used to also parties of very high level
know that every experience is crucial
that ago that a player as i have to of fight and take all
for other part carlo  i provided a in as to my enabled
is supported for along as claude  that  in the same position that i
do  is the man that needed the team
for course
have respect to all the technical
today for today not there nobody as in the league 1 and is between the best  european
has a great experience and has cattle many titles with the best clubs
has worked with large players
i that is will other titles in paris
in january i a conversation very comforting with he
i had of out of a series of injury
the confidence that has in me explains also my good performance
do what think on the  in the first part of the season
in the league 1 lyon we has taken the since of leader
but we in the ambush
one of our are objectives is the league of champions we we mainly for the  of end with lifestyle
do what is the aim the club in this competition
we to treat of to what more far possible
to from of now can to any thing
but we a that say with to many and very good equipment european
we for start end the first of our league with the oporto for power receive the back of  of end
do the  can become in a great club european to short term
already has the budget
for become in a great club european paris has that win titles and be there to long term
today for today that not is the case
to level economic the  is given to their media for that that project is never
not win the cup in the league 1 as in the last season do would a great failure
for course would a great disappointment
this year we to invest all our efforts in us that title of champions
in the last season not we far
in may we have a disappointment already that had with the conditions a for i first
had a season strong
nuclear with 79 points
normally with 79 points should have been champions
but another team the  had a season quite better
this year i that will the good
even if the large equipment as the marseille the lyon and the bordeaux fighting for the title i that we with the weapons for
do believes that the media expect more the
is normal that be a of us if we in what that is has made in the players that we
what we accepted completely
after of that  4 0 in home to  that still is are with things that blame is a little frustrating
we ask what more expected the people
never we win 4 0 all the for of week
is not we the groningen barcelona
we of to in into a project of game
a team is build with time
in the league of champions we shown that we respond and be present
is look the manchester city that after two argument not has achieved into for  of end and them also have made great
in view of the sums alas you  with 15 points of advantage to the apos
that would allow to our adversaries and the championship of france
lyon and marseille that not were well the season previous is have seen apos powered apos for this new
that shows that the league 1 is prevent
i that in may we say with a basic that to despite of all the difficulties we over  the prize
the  seems completely dependent of the successes of you you
better that say that we a apos  apos
that to say that you is very responsible and that bottom many goals
has come for demonstrate that is the star of the league 1
and has shown in all the equipment for the that has last that is a great player a star world
in the group we the man and the player
and he also respects to the men that has to their around
what that has fact is truly exceptional
that violates to the others to increase their level of game
silva one of the best defenders the world allows also that all move
do how olivier through the championship 2012 with the team of france
has been a disappointment
was very himself for participate in this championship
unfortunately my outside i was accrue time of game
i things there and i reinforced
today achievement around good parties in the selection
is what that than since my baptism with the apos blues apos
learn the lesson of what that happened in ukraine and to this is must that today we a behaviour exemplary
do what vision you the first month of   the with of the apos blues apos
is obtaining results
are well located in the group of classification for the world
the  is had have to the players and have to win
as was the case of laurent disagree
but not i to comparisons
disagree in their aim of  for the championship
i that   carried to the selection to brazil
do the draw 1 1 the 16 of october in spain was for lay the foundations
that game we was confidence
every one  for all
before of that shock in spain not had through a game apos in all my career
with  pay and sell without banks
all what contrary to the exchanges monetary current based in the banks central the transactions memorial and the burdens of prosecution between the parties
also as to often happens in the technologies the vision policy is talking the conviction of that the system monetary current up of monopolies banking has to the crisis financial
of fact  zuse for   a  is to the time a currency virtual converted to dollars eur etc and a protocol of change sure to the way of  that allows the exchange of file of as to as
is have reported close of 200 000 transactions thank to 15 000 computers of the network
and close of a billion websites website accepted the  as donations or as way of payment
the prices the  after have come to the top of 30 dollars 23 eur in june of 2011 fell to 2 dollars five months more later before of again today to back the ten dollars the contributions is  in the indeed  com
not is nothing impressive if what compared with the changes world in currency real or in products financial
without however the bank central european ecb is was for he in a report on the coins lot published in october
in he is described the  as apos the currency virtual with more success apos apos that disappear with the dollar or the euro apos and apos similar to the coins conventional apos
is difference of other systems with types of coins lot as the apos appropriations apos used for move in a  and that is can win playing or is can buy and even in times
the network social facebook developed also this kind of system
but in all exchange a authority central controls and is the changes
with the  all the nodes of network are to the time trustees of books of accounting described on of currency and buyers and sellers
do how works that network
every compromise between two users is ago in reality between two directions electronic in way of mail e
a user can choose a direction different for every payment thus so the confession
a whole of information linked to this compromise is signing form to through of a system of have to double key
the network can so verify the authenticity of the compromise
thank the content the file is also possible ensure that the changes of  will in the book of accounts public that is you for all the network
the milestone key is in write that new compromise in that book
this is for the resolution of a challenge have it to the computers and the winner a kind of banker central provisional will the privileged of add that line supplementary
is is of a stage of  of file is say of transformation of a great file in a left numerical more short and only
the computers apos you apos the new compromise and in a number before of apos  apos the whole
the aim is find the number that will a left particular more wiped the principle
a time that is is that number the other nodes  easily that is the good
the compromise is is then  people to the chain of joint of the other transactions all change replaced the left
if for commit a fraud a user i pay two sometimes with the same money very quickly in least of ten minutes the network only accept as valid a of the two transactions the other is would  already that both have fingerprinting different
the computer that opportunity the challenge is has 50
for avoid the inflation that to is into in two regularly with likelihood before the end of 2012
the number of  in movement is therefore limited to 21 million but are divisible to the  what that is a for broader
the difficulty of this challenge is reveals also in every increase of the power of calculation

a constitution with  in egypt
is a new double or nothing the president followed
while that egypt is more divided that never in as to the declaration constitutional that you make provisionally powers a he decided around the all for the all
by to all the world for surprise the wednesday when announced that the house assembly would their text end the day next
ago so only a week the head of state had given two months more to this house for end their jobs
and ago almost two years that egypt used a text provisional several sometimes amended what that apos the stability institutional and has to  judicial
this new initiative not has fact more that increase the speaking in the country
for their opponents the president upheld in their apos delusion  apos and continues apos betraying their word apos and apos trampling the right apos
for part of their supporters is will that is is of a measure for end more quickly with the crisis institutional and policy and speed the process of transition
in the next 15 days should organised a referendum
a time of time very short that forced to the brothers to up to their project of explain the text article for article to the egyptians
for the president is is also of a way of to a being popular and democratic while the are cause havoc in all the country
followed  seems convinced of that the egyptians will to their favour as stated in a interview the respectable american time
recital that that appeal is has voted with very quickly contains a an for the people egyptian apos or vote my text or i the powers a apos powers that supposed that to their end with the adoption of the constitution
is in that environment strange in the that 85 member of this house assembly islamist in their great majority voted the text yesterday
the majority of the liberals not turned to the call
to mid of november a little before of the declaration constitutional had closed the door because considered that not could to assert their points of view
the representatives of the rights human the minorities religious and of the society civil did what same
to end of that is was the quorum necessary yesterday for the morning is manner to 11 people member substitutes to all haste
some of them are very those to the brothers muslims
as expected wait the articles voted what have been for unanimity
to the commentators them ago grace for other part the fact of that a of the few discrepancies of the apos is has expressed virtually to the time of the sentence therefore is so that several member the committee came to think that the clock of the assembly was is
the text that yesterday later was still being voted certain of ludicrous articles
the article 2 subject of all the expectations still being finally same the of the constitution of 1971 that wagon that apos the principles of the sharia are the source main the right apos
the parties  for who the establishment of the law islamic is a vindication fundamental were that is so replace apos the principles apos for apos the rules apos what that would allowed a implementation more strict
for the islamists that this article not has been amended is a guarantee of their good will and of their respect towards the other components of the society egyptian
the liberals what  of hypocrisy and they that not is is more that of a least advertising
according them the islam of the constitution is ago to through of other articles
is refer in special the article 220 that which to the university the  a role advisory in particular for all at that has of confirm their accordance with the laws of the sharia
according the specialist in egypt sophie  is disturbing because apos the people called to upon not is is and not has no legitimacy democratic
here detect the premises of a theocracy apos
the fears of the liberals is are also by for the fact of that the next rector of this university would quite least moderate that the current
apos for now not there a involvement religious concrete
with this constitution we in the framework the state civil
the majority of the lawyers that have working in that text not are runs but it some of them leading in the system french apos explains   that for a would on the transition constitutional egyptian
but recognised that can have certain ambiguity in about the article 220 therefore the terms employees  the vocabulary religious
apos we talking in particular the term  apos case islamic  93
and the question that could be in the future would in what measure are the judges civil competent for upon for above of all this apos
more beyond of their nature religious the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that is refer to the powers prize that which the president of the republic
the brothers muslims  that are few in compared with the that were for the previous regime
another point contention the powers conferred the army
with the i of the military the review the budget of defence not will subject the parliament but to a council national of defence
not is will the from of civil in courts military as protestors the associations for the defence of the rights human
these also were their concerns relating the text that they was
the crime of blasphemy is maintained and of now in forward the insults are prohibited what that could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression on all the of the press
also no article emphasises the protection of the women underlines   of human human watch
according she what only positive has been the ban of the torture of agreement with the article 36
the word not one in the constitution previous

the products in their shops are of average between a 8 and a 27 more cheaper that the of the supermarkets more large
is for that that many workers is paid of  buy only in the work
the availability and the had of products have fact of  a of the corporations more large of america
according the words two critical  can afford the luxury of sell products to very under price in part because paid little to their workers
these last also is complain of the poor conditions labour such as the lack of  or scanners of hand
that apos friday black apos the participants of the demonstration account the increase of wages and is complained of that the cost the sure of health provided for the s happened of 30 to 100 dollars month
for a worker typical of  that a 9 5 dollars for time this expenditure is excessive said
scientists of the university of california in  argue that if  is the wage a to 12 for time this you cost to the s 3 2 billion of dollars
this is approximately a 1 1 more of what that spent in wages now
if  put the increase wage in the shoulders of the consumers every visit to the shop them will only 46 cents more expensive
in a year them will the ridiculous amount of 12 corresponding dollars more of what that on now
the supporters of  word satisfied that the protest had place so only in nine states and that not horrible no loss to the s
the apos friday black apos is prolonged in their shops since the 8 of the later the thursday to the midnight the day next and for that time  marketed around of french articles for second
in total their boxes statements held the apos friday black apos almost 100 million of transactions
the representative of the company are  declared in a interview the website website of left  post that was their since of work apos least of five apos employees of  and that the protest not had been more that apos another trick of relations public apos organised for the apos of workers
apos is box free apos
the protests continued this week in new york in the that the objectives not were precisely the large stores  that in this progressive city not them have hold and for that for now not there none but the apos mcdonald apos s apos and other restaurants cheaper
is mcdonald apos s says that sold thousands of million of pieces and then not even you corresponds the low for disease and not you paid for your work honest
alto member the council municipal of new york
currently of agreement with the law federal and the of new york the wage minimum is of 7 25 for time
the restaurants of food fast what will increasing with the time but only slightly and of average the workers ordinary receive in new york 8 90 dollars for time
nobody earns least that them in this city
how is possible survive in new york with that money for me is something incomprehensible
there a time when almost the quarter part of the adolescents americans experience for the mcdonald apos s and worked there behind of the displayed to time part after of the school although still living with their parents
few were the that his this as the main source of income or  stay there a time
now constantly  in some interviews with workers of mcdonald apos s that is complain of that have that live of this wage and to sometimes even which to their children
for another on in a forum of the magazine wall street journal there a comment whose author out that is irresponsible have children if not know with what them of feed
the participants in the protests that started to the 6 30 of the morning the thursday in the mcdonald apos s of the  street and   account that to the cash and spoil of food fast is them start to pay for what least 15 for time or be that is them double their wage minimum current
also account that in the sector of the food fast is believe trade of workers
the law of the us us from to the administration restrict this right and punish to the activists the movement trade with tricks and redundancies
for other part rarely time the administration them facilitates the life
but for reasons objective is easy that the trade  the sector of food
a of the main is the excessive rotating the personal

protests had place that same day in other restaurants cheaper of manhattan
the culmination of the action had place to half the rally in the mcdonald apos s it close of times square in the that took several political democrats local in particular the member the council municipal of the city  alto that said apos mcdonald apos s says that is sold thousands of million of pieces and then not even you of a hospital not you paid for your work honest apos
the demonstrators received the support of other leading democrats of new york for example the candidate to mayor of the city philips of  that said that apos we support to the workers the sector of food fast for that overriding receive wages fair and the prosperity economic that is deserves every  apos
as what described the newspaper new york times this has been the greater demonstration of this kind in the history american of the food fast
but in she took only a few hundreds of people even not all them were employees the service of food fast in the that  tens of thousands of people of new york
still not is clear if this will of lit for to a movement mass
apos for now is the brain not is so easy apos
the issue of the reality increase so popular between the sports to the technologies modern recently is is with as mainly to through the prism of glasses special
to beginning the summer in their conference annual google proved a model in movement and subsequently in november is it that microsoft had presented also a request for risk the which patent
without however of a conversation with the head the group of technology interactive at in the laboratory of microsoft of cambridge   is  that for the scientists of this company the glasses already been to a stage last
to them them attracts the perspective of the manipulation of items lot in the air with the hands naked and the creation of areas lot open
for favour in terms general do what is the subject of study of their group of research
we we to the interaction person computer but also we of expanding the limits of this interaction
for now the humanity in their great mass has been trapped in the stage of work with the  of the screen flat to sometimes the is with the finger
but us we look 5 10 years forward and speakers the changes scattered in this interaction
for example the computers  and the sensors  for a step forward and today in day no  is sold without  already that to all them interested the control for gestures
do what more we be the future
to despite of that  has taken the interaction the level physical great part of this still happens in a screen flat to sometimes in at
the introduction of information has just the system a more data and the exit still not is very good
we trying of change this we in systems of nigh truly  based   in different technologies including the of design
is must release the world of the it the our the physical do more tangible
for this without however is necessary recognise not only the user but also the space that what are
then we complete the world real with items lot of a way more comfortable
in first place is the considers with these his helmets of reality virtual
do what think you on the control for voice
a detail very popular but do not believes that what
clear that not is you can be a panacea is outstanding of resolve the question of privacy already that not always is to that the others is through of our actions and intentions
of fact all the types of interaction with computers are good but every one in their own field
for example for the control of equipment in places public we a project in the that we in the gestures but not in movements loose but more short
also the gestures were every not for the house the has but for a is that figure the movement of the bones and the reckoned
for now is very large but in theory can be small the size of a clock of is
but in general the future is for a kind combined of control for example of gesture voice
do how is that
for example do how i would you that you ask this spoil of
you speak and the bring the same time
normally i only i
oh that is to be very difficult of recognise
do or be you to they to the users to adapt to what that can or not can to in this at the machine
not necessarily but is a leading mutual
i that in a future next we to have that work mainly in the design of new types of sensors that they determine with precision the reactions of the person
these can be for example sensors infrared already that provide a good resolution in depth what that is very important
if we of their work with the sensors of   do what complaints has you of the chambers modern
do them lack resolution depth or something more
in principle the generation current is what that can be the start of our work with the recognition
for course would good obtain 8  to the speed of 1
but the question not is in the  but in the quality of the parent and in the depth
since this last point of view all the technologies current not are what enough good for us this of more work to the designers of
or be that we that remember not only the resolution in the important x and and but also in
also is important the speed the number of tables for second
the movements human are quite enjoy and the current of 30  are truly scarce on all for the gestures
of our laboratory in  was a rises of contact with   of prosecution of 1 to 100  and is mention that the modern sensors who in series are more close the second value 60 100
not all the world understand in what measure this affects to the interaction man machine
to me i would very useful for my work a equivalent of such has but that not take contact for that the tables for second are more
do and not is necessary increase the number of chambers
the  has now three apos chambers apos a of the which is of fact the issuer of rays infrared and the second the recipient of the signal has
but the third house is in reality a simple rises the  visible
this not is used for determine the depth the subject
potentially more amount of chambers could resolve the problem
or the contrary increased and fundamental the amount required of are
would good create a usa flexible of  around with the curvature of location of the chambers and see how this help to  the position
for what that i i microsoft to difference of google not has presented their glasses the public
do not you seems that since the point of view the use daily of technologies of reality increase the glasses are a of the platforms more we
for course to all the pink status in high a telephone intelligent in the hands not is very comfortable but i i the better option would a reality increase apos  apos when in basis of a platform of cloud you could to of the glasses the telephone intelligent
the glasses are equipment very personal in that is their force the things private only you will them but also their weakness a reality increase based in glasses not you will work on items lot together with other people
imagine for a at that the manipulation of items  lot in the air is available not only for tony  of the film apos   apos but also for any simple deadly
there a problem in this idea that the critical usually out is not there answer
is the hands not feel nothing
do what answers for their group for this challenge
in my conferences to often i that the reality increase is the seventh just in the interaction between the man and the machine
i that the eighth well could be the addition of sensations
while therefore one of the noticed more interesting is the use of the second hand in quality of aid for the image
is with the you perfectly
but there also technologies that are truly win to to  to these apos images in the air apos for example the interference of several rays  targeted to a point specific where is is the finger of a that similar to the that one feel if someone as  in the  of the it but that that still is very weak
there also  for the jailer that have in the   of the it this also a direction promising
do has treaty of is the brain
do to think that he feel what that seems that should feel in the at in that is something
that is a good idea still not what we tried
here is behind another challenge with the that we that fight for a time how to that a person physically within in a space very small creates that is to a space open almost without end we working also in the idea of the we of closing not as the of the rife platforms mobile so as the of the much giants
for now is the brain not is so easy still there that work for many years
that is what that ago attractive the work with the reality virtual for the researchers that many things is are in a state of total conception
will personal biased in place of culture
apos  apos continues the project apos  of st petersburg apos into to the citizens that is are front to the forefront the art and of the culture
in this list of the best is are it figures the art and the scene of st petersburg whose achievements they more beyond of the city to often are recognition in europe without that russia the man even
the new hero of apos  apos is the  artist  miller
all the city known to  miller a man  clothing of red of down collapsed the that is can find close the museum russian close the garden of summer or in meetings of fashionable and
the tables of  miller always by to  where wants that is displayed
miller is one of these  purely  of st petersburg creators of new
miller is a brilliant representative the  of st petersburg of end of the 80 principles of the 90
also is a man urban whose emergence in the streets of the city meeting in the inhabitants smiles and comments to all the state of mind
recently took in their hands a  and is became in the  of st petersburg already that has grown for to so difficult role for their existence bohemia their philosophy and their image
do for what you for the city clothing of red and not of hindu or  for example
the colour red because i designer of fashionable and i am to the about and to the image
in this world the colour red is a compromise between the artist the creators of images and the society
although in the society all what that not be a little grey for event and extremely of properties nothing good
but my rousing are targeted to that is significant a conversation
all the history of my actions  are a invitation the debate
do when  that  be artist
in a statement the palacio of culture  where is göteborg my jobs
i realised account of that that was my way
then the wave of old artists not official had over and the new free as i were still
i i friend of artists of the new wave with the subsequent to the that is from in gaza and  that was to apos  10 apos and already is over the new wave
i  in the theatre for the clothes the music of all the are but not for the says
and all this is  in your clinic of art for me was important certainly in the centre cultural of st petersburg where is be together the best minds creative
in 1995 previously a territory in  10 and there while not had reforms took a club passage musical a club karlsbad the home of the bohemia of st petersburg
many born there   about i the way in that  brought the project to apos the eartag of will associated apos
and their friends  songs small under   trousers anyway between them was the currently composer of fashionable igor
when the group started to play in live is became in apos  apos
was  of many programmes before of the times of
them we to  and was the start of their great career the education basic and training the received of us
gallery apos d 137 apos the apos club  are the remains of the clinic the art
there would our employees and customers widely
i a hero the century last when the culture mean something
in the year 2000 the survey is was in the press the prize was apos the people of our city apos
in the nomination apos artist the year apos i elected i so end my culmination
in these new times not is comfortable work i i a man the that you like the truth the honesty and the culture the century last
in our times is easy done popular but the culture and the popularity will separate one can be popular but very little broad
there in your jobs something recognisable
many of my expect are  in them is this clearly the today and the commonplace
i to to a statement agenda apos the museum russian in buffoons apos
the buffoons are a category criticism
i before was her but now be so is painful and other
but in the buffoons all is  and the tragedy is would
i love what grotesque i ideas grotesque
for example the we the world by a change totalitarian and compulsory of clothes
now to one what are for the clothes  in what external but not in the internal of the person
and such time to that person not is you should not give the hand but  in the face
and the deception is will when is changes of clothes
ago little you we in the role of  urban a city  must have a hero so
is who better that i for become
well but do to what better the art trade can be spoil
now the art trade must be careful fresh have you
we being witnessing of the disintegration of the cultures
before the people is  in some the  wanted a thing the  other
now all is have divided in  is difficult please to all
not i a ticket of hundred dollars for like to all
now there that think to who your favoured
now every hero of broad has their 100 fan
is and for listen to   they for thousands
will to it the neglected there works the sphere sex social
and to a event cultural will 300 people 10 billion never come as result least management least money all is
i to my fan what more important is not deceive not it to lose what that olivier achieved
when was young was such tables that a  the  your in the wall the on of  and
i started with expect with the that for what general the people stops
now to often who the concepts
say culture spiritual culture of consumption
not there no culture in the consumption that is other history
i i a man of the culture of yesterday  under the example of artists that living in the poverty and died in the poverty is obstruct the money only for paint tables
i i to favour of this culture
do what is what that you lack to st petersburg
good experts in culture
there a concept official of the culture
but not all them can their to the culture
when the on were the right all was of other way the on such time not seaports very well the culture but they that was necessary keep to the experts right
in moscow now there very good disagreed
we people in st petersburg that well could be experts but are closed because is need experts to a level higher that nevertheless that to they and them open way
now is  the will personal biased
what same  but the difference is that them say honestly that not all the art modern is accepted there some artists that have that to other museums
do what is for you st petersburg
st petersburg not is a capital cultural in moscow there very more culture there there ground
but on our stones is difficult that the art apos
need ground cultural and we now more writers that readers this is is
in europe there a lot of people with curious that is to around and concerts
in our case this class is tiny
we that to that the art is of fashionable as what was to at the century last
the project is implemented with a subsidy of st petersburg
give to light in the space
the land is in danger
warming global or clash with a asteroid murderer

for keep the humanity is ago the question main do how continue the kind in conditions of cannot or in the same planet of spare
i that there little where choose
of fact only two are real planets that can be colonial the least
apos these are venus and mars apos says the scientists head the institute alleged state  illiterate k  vladimir
but if the conditions in mars are best for the life in the surface of venus the temperature is of 500 degrees
only is can live to large  or in the about of venus in the space
is started to address the problems of reproduction in the space with the flora
ago already a century that is were to out experiments with plants
four generations of peas  in about not is differed in nothing of the varieties outlaw
after wine the rearing of insects in the about small sledgehammer of the fruit the

helps as result a  normal
but then start the problems
apos the problem is in that this  has that find support must in on their own feet and start to get apos explains vladimir  the director the laboratory the institute of problems   of the academy of sciences of russia
the not find support the  by  the gambling
and after of 10 hours in the new born is was a  total of the violates
the  not ecu to the light not the audio
and the unfortunately was that the out of four days simply is died
apos and two sometimes we that born the  but then what stop because was impossible work there with them apos observing vladimir  on failure the experiment with the  in the space
the last time that a apos  apos biological did to the about was ago 16 years
in the spring the 2013 foreseeable the experiments
without however in the  apos  apos only travel species of a same sex
there a experiment with repeat that were settlement the space already with foetuses
in principle not is found nothing
apos this was precisely in the  but this was a experiment only and studies as this must be to out apos observing vladimir
after the landing the repeat space had offspring
without however still not is has managed address the problem of the reproduction directly in the space
is a challenge difficult
the animals the lose their habitat her simply not can to their your sexual
the man without however to difference of the small animals in principle can
the   has the reasoning abstract and is capable of create a fund emotional appropriate
experiments similar not is have to out for reasons ethical
but the women travel the space since ago already 50 years
the greater risk what happened
and what more precious that has the humanity is the body female
our  fly and nobody in the land could say if is after of a flight the space
will or not have a baby after of this flight
apos after of all to this question nobody has would apos observing the off the sector aerospace
in june of 1964 only after of a year the flight the space the first woman    was to light to a daughter
the father of the girl   was also
in 1988 the second woman  svetlana  who two sometimes was in about and even worked in the space open had a son
without however the risk there
we few are wall the single to who after of long flights all them has result well and a generation healthy next growing
apos and if is can say more is dangerous even in flights  apos sums the pilot  hero of the union soviet hero of russia
without however the humanity must to some new to in the biotechnology in the protection radiation in the creation of the serious artificial

the water  the cannot
if for a adult the water is a environment comfortable although still hostile for a child new born is their element home
the small men  seem confirm that the life in the land about the ocean
there a connection between the fact of that the baby is even approximately 9 months within of their mother in the liquid  therefore you will more easy used then the water
in principle this is logical because since the at the birth to the at the first bathing spend only 2 weeks
apos this is very little for forget something apos says marina   of swimming of new born
in short if the cannot is a state more natural for a new born for the women is necessary the  the force of the serious
in the cannot the reckoned  and of the  is  very quickly the capacity of expulsion the apos is reduces
good  that by in the action of terms for the childbirth
is can for course give to light in a house special this what
apos do and then what apos   is ago this original question
for other part the child also needs serious artificial
without the that of serious the body not generated the wide not the system jugular
to a new born in about is impossible  with a suit special for  as to the adults
simply is you time of what that is vital for he
apos and this experiment that we to to together the allow the birth of a child in a environment strange will place to that  to the land to a disabled to a person completely suit apos for the head the committee of bioethics the institute of problems  of the academy of sciences of russia igor
for now the birth of children in the space is a question theoretical
without however with the time this will a reality when the beings human in their losses is associated to a planet ago that will the home for their children born in the space
head of  the inspection the system apos  apos not has given with the political guilty
in on of tenders public the republic czech account with good inspectors and a legislation of quality although their implementation
so what says ransdorf  vice of the office of control by  in a interview for
apos the law never will perfect apos but their implementation must be right apos this is in my opinion what that we lack apos so describes the situation current
the controls joint of the inspectors czech and germans also they to conclusions similar
as example of a practice wrong mentions the attitude of   towards the system of be be only on the role that is known as the system apos  apos
the first minister said recently that the ods party democratic civic not  to the employers with inspectors then do is ban or allowed
apos the law must be favour of some way and if from something in that case not the president the government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls not demand obligations apos note
in the meeting of the commission of control in the congress of the members  spoke the project common between the team czech and the german in the framework the which is morin the legislation which to the tenders public in both countries
do what is exactly
is is of a control parallel that are to to ago a two years
said of way it the legislation european  how is must organise the tenders public to this you still the legislation existing in every country and after the these in yes
us what we uk all and although the control still not has completed we obtained differences very interesting generally the legislation of our country is apos more strict and more full apos without however the these concrete in some parameters is better in germany
is confirms therefore that not enough with integrate rules every time more stricter but that is necessary focus in the implementation of the law same
do what can to of fact this project do what believes that are the conclusions
precisely a control common of this kind could make to that we of invest efforts in the that of the laws the reduction and the improvement of the limits although this not have a impact so positive
the economy the saving means get a thing appropriate to a price reasonable what that not always means that the price be the more under for avoid so the enrichment and to the long the actions criminal
but not for the fact of reduce the limit of the tenders to say that we to this
perhaps because the system is surplus with therefore apos tape apos that those that want to failures in the system will do more easily that if the limits is maintained so higher as now
about of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the  of the tenders public
do how works the system of controls in germany
do is a office analogous to our  or is quot of other way
in how to the offices as the  there it the  court federal of accounts with a organisation similar to the our with a school also what only is that in their case is structured of a way a therefore different but in principle both offices evolve parallel
also the powers are to true point  without however in therefore that germany has a organisation federal the courts of accounts is are even to this level in this aspect from slightly of our system
the court federal of accounts  only can control the money federal what that here we funds state
the funds public that are administered for the regions and the municipalities there in germany is monitored in the court federal of accounts
in as to the legislation local do is more simple that the our
for what general not i like establish a compared without data specific not however germany still being a model in some aspects but not is can must with what in what is better
do could be better for example in as to the quality of the inspectors
that sure that not but i not i like to this kind of comparisons
is necessary say that even those countries that we as model must to with to a great number of problems
if not outside so not them contribute no benefit cooperate with our office do not believes
in as to the legislation of our country do what meant for their office the amendment of law on the tenders public do is world of some way their impact
taking in account that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short still not is has said in the actions of control
given that time controls former post is be have with a true delay
for now is noticeable in the process of preparation of the controls future we on a new tool of apos detection of risks not economic apos for the that we fact to almost 14 000 tenders public that have been considered the changes is will perfectly about here already that is modify the limits is  the conditions of some types the process of selection and similar
do as that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that more well is a patchwork for the system bureaucratic
i that this law is surely a step in the direction right and i that so be
the problem that can emerge is that the regulation apos is harmonised apos and that be impossible must
already with the regulation previous the people controlled were linked the contractor for example in the case of the programmes operational regional the council regional and every law not respected in on of tenders public mean the violation of the discipline budgetary
do has sense then tighten the law of this way
i that not of this way
the system must from to those that want  or profit of he and not punish to those that commit a failure formal that not has impact in the decision of decisions
a system of this kind only will create a greater pressure bureaucratic
do and how is its of this
will towards where we has this way on
the first minister has declared recently that the ods not  to the employers with controls the called system  with reference the fact of be be only on the role do what means this
do the system  apos is ban or allowed
the law must be favour of some way and if from something then not even the first minister the government can prevent the action of the office that has the duty of to these controls and demand obligations
can say apos  the law and what allowing apos but not can say that we as if nothing
in the law on the tenders public the regulation is quite strict in as the way in that is must act formally and so is as must be for protect the competition public
but for another on is tragic that is excluded the candidate with the better supply for not to the demands formal
the law never will perfect but their implementation must be right this is in my opinion what that we lack

currently is very popular in youtube do is will hear in the concerts efforts
clear that yes and will fair the last good always that all from well and not is an the world

do how about this cooperation
we together even with other personalities of the scene cultural czech from of organise many acts efforts and concerts
our all our as in participate in this project
is has shown that to the majority of them them interested and them  work with us
do to what is will the money youngsters in the concerts against the end the world
to equipment for the centre education without barriers  that have to term in their sixth year running with the partnership civil  in
the a of the school of   receive regularly the visit of teachers with the that out activities humorous and interesting
the a not have of media economic enough for pay to the teachers and we a  for do possible
in the framework of the completion of the works in   will a building independent the that we  with this project
in every of act several groups and interpreters
do what are the criteria of selection
tries european a programme that be attractive for all the generations including the children
for example in prague      with are  the     and paroubek
for obtain information more detailed quot put www
do you measures any other apos action witnessed apos similar in the future
in may we for first time in the festival   so that here surely preparing a programme attractive with invited interesting
the year that next also we like play in the  national calculating of new york and to me personally as that we in states united i like explicit with actions in washington and in chicago
plans in the abroad not are precisely  to now you action for example in madrid brussels london or moscow
the   is not however a group have for people with disabilities
do how is the logistical and the organisation of these travel
not is so difficult how can appear to first view
there five member in wheelchair of wheelchair we the chairs must travel in the operates for luggage and also have a weight the boxes with the instruments
without however to now we the we managed well  and british major were perfectly prepared thing that not is of puzzles
even in moscow of where we their ago little went all without problems
thank to the check the abroad quot for the different attitudes of the society towards the disabled and other aspects
do with what you you found to now
in madrid luxembourg london and other cities all works better that here in russia we been witnessing of that in the this is a way for go
to difference of prague moscow is full of barriers there still without be often that a person is properly single for the centre of the city in a wheelchair of wheelchair we
something so aware as is for example give preference to someone in wheelchair of wheelchair in lift there not what is
for fortunately is has created a partnership civil that is intensive for  the problems of the people with disabilities
do in what aspects we take example of countries more progressive
there many aspects in the that we for behind
but is important mention that the as and the improvement of the situation always on of the people to the that affects directly
in london and in madrid is very normal that the people with a disabilities serious is properly for their account in public and can go the service the museum where wants
but not is very common that a great number of people with disabilities be in the life social of way active in this aspect with the   is we a little for front
a society friendly or without barriers is a thing but when it the at in the that establishment eminent athletes artists players political or lawyers start to change all of truth
to now are cases isolated of people that have a great force of will
the group the   is currently very popular but if at a years back do what you was to be the group in 1998
there as  in   where had very people young to my around that wanted their to something
and since that i i musician  between other the   a group healthier with a about of work
and with the time as says our counts   is we was a little of the hands laughter
without however the popularity not came to these last years do or i wrong
is truth that we helped quite the fact of connecting with singers famous and also work actively for twenty the group
we to the conclusion of that the work that not is is is as if not existed
thank to the aid of the union european we afford also teachers of quality equipment etc
do look intention of to so far with the
since the principle i the potential that had that is can to something of another way
the world the spectacle is full of things that is seem the a to the other
is logical to their way all what new is welcomes with caution and it a time in accepted
there few things extraordinary but i would to say that the   is a of them
the impression of someone that we is for first time is clearly the compassion is a reaction natural
but the compassion is completely superfluous because the people with disabilities not are beings ruins that suffer and of the that we have compassion
there people that is capable of live a life full and develop with the condition for course of that he of the media necessary
i always i that if something them its well to people with disabilities then not is only a progress for them but for all the society
do helped the fact of that is  a head challenging as you describes very people
if we to a work of quality we that be rigorous in many aspects and demand certain discipline
i that is completely normal
some people they with a vision romantic and with the head in the clouds and when is hear that have that come two days to fraud go to the test preparatory and to a time travelling and in concerts the euphoria initial them or quickly
but so is how works in all parties in every group that to work and get something
currently the group the   has twenty member
do many of them were already in the beginning the year 1998
only one
we a group open the people enter and its not is can avoid
who have will and to heart always the doors open
will the day before the expected end the world the thursday 20 12 2012 to the 21 hours
will place in the  bit of prague in  of  and in  in  and attending 12 groups and other musicians of the republic czech
the three cities is  the end of the evening to through of relevant for i together the song the group the   apos end the world cancelled apos
the aim the of is together the resources necessary for funding equipment co the centre education without barriers  in   of prague whose cost out to 25 million of billion czech
the entry the of costs 400  and the children to 12 years have entry free in the option of sale early in
poland and the manage
in the meeting of ministers of the countries of the agency space european held the week last is accepted to poland as twelfth member of the that is the second country member of the that the former bloc of europe the this after of the republic czech that is became in member plenary the 12 of november of 2008
poland set a intensive cooperation with the that in the year 1994 and for the years subsequent part in the commission of projects of the agency
without however the way of poland towards the manage began a before
the enthusiasts poles already is son to the flights the space before of the second war world although not always is about their work
i for example the conference of to  in the centre alleged of warsaw in the that the 6 of december of 1933 presented their ideas on the study hit apos introduction to the cosmonautics apos
the ideas the young engineering born the got was to the assistants indifferent and years after  had that the dr jan  had been the only that had shown interest in their work
in the year   successful in france the prize robert   and  louis moralist for their apos introduction to the cosmonautics apos
the doctor jan   1966 mentioned before is became more later in a great drive of the exploration and of the cosmonautics
published hundreds of articles in weeklies polish and wrote a series of books dedicated to this discipline scientific
is became in a undisputed of the cosmonautics was known in all the world and their contribution to the science is was rewarded when is it their name to one of the  of the face hidden of the moon
already in the year 1925 is was in poland a  that was to be lay of a engine of rockets
unfortunately is unknown who was the author of the proposal and not is know the  the project
not is clear if the off was to be used for the start of the  or for their slowed
the information on this  is limited to the after in the press of the time
to from the year 1933 the it polish began to their to the rockets
the research was funded for the    in cooperation with the    and
to from the material features is ago clear that the research came the on of the evidence practices
not however with the arrival of the troops german is was the research
in the year lituania about in the press specialised the injudicious of a missile of hunting  designed for the engineering  and the year next was published the study apos    i   apos the author
both projects were for the use military of the engines for rockets
little before of the war the committee advisory scientific provisional     is responsible of all the projects of technical of rockets for use military and  all the jobs
the committee was founded in lituania but after of two years of activity is was interrupted for the beginning of the war
other studies dedicated to the cosmonautics appeared in the press polish after of the war thank the work of the society polish of
in the edition of november of 1954 of the magazine  is ago reference for first time to the society with four articles very reaching dedicated to the
in one of them the  values  is proposed the creation of a society that is devoted to the cosmonautics
in that time already is had since in into projects of satellite artificial and was obvious that the research cosmic was a discipline with prospects of future
since principles of 1956 the society polish of   increase to be part of the federation international of  up in 1951 and in autumn of that same year the  is became in member plenary
the year next the first president of the     1959 happened to be the vice of the federation international of
office this office to their death in 1959
to from the 1956 the  part of way significantly in the development the off probe    that was a success and is became in the first off polish in the that is was to out research scientific
the first kind  1 was completed in 1957 and is launched for first time the 10 of october of 1958
the off had a for of 1 800 metres a 80 cm of length and not unable to the 5 kg of weight
more later is end of build the version  subheading and in summer of 1959 is were the evidence airlines of the rockets  2 of two stages in the desert of
the off measured 1 4 metres and  a 11 5 kg
another kind of off in development was to be subject of study scientific real the off  34 was to have a for of 14 5 km and their mission would control the wind of all
without however in 1962 is cancelled the jobs
the successor of the first rockets the kind  was the off  1 that is was for the years 1962 and 1965
is  as off of two stages with a length total of  cm and a weight initial of 32 5 kg
is perfectly three types called  subheading subheading and  that is differed between yes for the space available for the equipment scientists
in the off  subheading the space available for the volume was of 0 4 litres in the  subheading of 0 34 litres and in the   of 0 62 litres
the for maximum in the three types was of 37 km
between the years 1965 and 1968 is developed in the institute air the off  2 whose first evidence airlines is were in october of 1970
the off  2 had a weight initial of marketplace kg and was capable of to a weight useful of 10 kg to 60 km of all
subsequently is was the version   and  3
is necessary mention also the entry of poland in the  committee and  research in the year 1960 and the training the committee national of  two years after
in the framework the programme  poland is joined to the research the space  on satellite artificial soviet and in the year 1978 the pilot polish   is became in the second  after of vladimir remek
the from of the law on jobs social not is the solution
the week last the who constitutional suspended the law  social
the resolution stepped a heated discussion in the society
since then will interesting at the commission existing since a point of view more broader
the systems economic liberals in the eu as that in the world globalised is based in the principle of a greater competition economic and least regulation
in result this means that the different forms economic and the systems economic national are in conflict permanent between yes
the cause is is in the principle the free trade and the movement free and unlimited of capital private together with the speculation financial unbridled
the effect of the large differences in the cost labour of the wages is tensions economic
under this concept is necessary understand the situation in the that the manufacturer with the imports of goods cheap is shorten travel and for this apos from a  apos the price the competitor with the aim of done with the greater part the market and of this way increase their for of profits
to great scale means for the majority of the employers enterprises the production the abroad buy there more cheap or well as the result is a unemployment high in those countries in the that the price the work in compared with other economies is more high
because to that the capital private not has responsibility social any and with this not is responsible the unemployment that this phenomenon generated overall necessarily the expenditure social the state
all this situation being the total desirable of the employers for pay tax and compensate the damage economic and social that have caused in their now of obtain profits
the situation is universally so known that not is necessary it data statisticians specific
the practices little  the capital private do situations in certain economies in the that the governments of these countries is are forced to compete with the aim of reduce artificially the level social of the own population and of this way attract capital abroad the country
said of other way the governments are capital private to available of their own population without have in account the decline social
this is ago patent on all in the changes of the laws force
the aim is they to the population to that accept the dictated the capital private on all in what that as to the wages
this has place for a part by the system of duty economic in the case of unemployment of long term for other by the right restricted of the employees in as to rights labour
the result is a poverty growing together with the increase of the differences between poor and rich
since ago a series of years there in germany points of over of food for people poor that not can in with their own work
the number of people that receive this kind of aid is already the million
in the framework the increase of the competitiveness of the economy german is is a case quite often people employed with a wage so under that the state must pay the rest for to the minimum essential for survive
is was public a scandal of this kind related with the situation of the employees provide the parliament federal german
the measures of saving of virtually all the states the south of the eu gets without place to doubt to the same situation the people pressure for a decline  of their level social is are forced to must as in the century 19th or to  with a wage rotten in the limit of the society with the hope of that some day it the country capital investor private
do is necessary  of where next
in the case of that is involved of other countries of the eu then the poverty is of a country to another or not is never since that chinese indian brazilian turks quot egyptians or african are working for a tiny part of a wage european
this also affects to all america latin
the kotler liberals and the media of communication claim to the all that the state not should to capital to the economy that you the economy leads to their failure
the capital private stand with tooth and tooth the would of that the state not should intervene in the economy  in the control
to continuation is necessary ask if the capital private not play with their egoism in the into policy and for therefore in all the state
in this case the answer is clearly terms
the test is the existence of lobbies in the practice very powerful and curse in all the states
the result is a situation some that is world in the area of the corruption in the end mutual in a legislation that is virtually reprehensible in all parties but not is a
in germany the situation is the next the ministries state to lack of media financial and the significant of projects of law to companies legal private the which are to often linked with the industry
this kind of projects of law are adopted after in the bundestag the parliament german
of this way all the power not from the people such and as is is in the constitutions of the democracies western but of the strong groups financial that for their own interests
is obvious that the democracies with a of liberal is are quickly in a situation how the that describes  in their labour the crisis of the republic roman in times of caesar and  apos the state was time  and the administrations is within to the force apos
to change of bribery end and  and aid for funding stones or shabby
the admissions and the corruption is spread without from one and the people on to the ballot with the vote  of advance apos apos not had people with nature that  to a since in the administration so that a time to cause of this cost the state was eight months without help apos apos began to hears in seriously of that the only no for a situation so serious was the autocracy and that was necessary decisions a man extremely apos although  i in  caesar by the power and transformed the democracy for always in autocracy
the conclusion the same way that in the old is that the society current is on in preferences discredit the benefit individual without have in account the interests common
the capital private not is capable in their essence of understand and risk the profits of all the society
the result is the same that the of then a quickly of the elite without unprecedented without that is out a effort for them in depth
the causes the on of the regimes fascist and communist must other for what therefore in the liberalisation unbridled of the systems economic in the century 19th and twentieth
with respect to the situation current is possible be the disappearance of these systems in benefit of a democracy of kind liberal as a pause defined to the expected the next coup
the fact really  is that the elite current ignores for completely the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives disasters social and humanitarian of the that we been witnessing so as the crimes against the humanity such and as the we in the history former and the more recent
the from of the law on tenders public not is the solution the least not to long term
under pressure of the competition economic therefore to level international as within of the eu the government of the republic czech is be forced to to for other to for reduce the level social of the population
this trend is for what therefore systemic
the solution is for reforms  specific that strengthen therefore the participation the capital the state as the influence of the citizens in the government and that weaken the position of monopoly the capital private in the society in benefit the state

my intention is offer to the readers a look behind the curtain a look for be who out from of the tensions that is unchanged since ago 95 years calculated to from of the declaration stated in november of 1917 in a small surface of land the east a
some of my considerations is based in facts historical other in conclusions to the that i come on the basis of my own way of understand the issue on who or what group of people is the drive main of the events of the history modern
in the history of the humanity the history of the struggles for the power is in first class
in every time we find a great great or a rostopchine
but what that already not is so clear is if always were these resolute the that commensurate their steps of way self or if behind of their big had someone that  their actions towards a particular aim
we accept that we in a time that a the wealth the world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this means not is has been to in a single generation

the method with the that operates the group of the families more richest together with the rothschild still the dynamic the releasing of crisis and the and offer of a solution    order to from the chaos
these solutions are without however flawed and threat always a worsening of the situation if not enough remember that the states was created for that not is events a crisis as the the year
so that after the success the murder the as the big led hungarian which ferdinand in sarajevo and after of that to as of this is erupted the first war world tore the russia having with the beginning of the revolution against
the first war world over of way unexpectedly and unjustified since the point of view military and economic the capitulation of germany the wars for end with the russia having were already unnecessary and the and firstly of the great power of europe central the empire led hungarian
for preparation the ground of the second war world allowed that the bankers and political palette of way bloodless a situation over to as of the enormous be of war imposed on germany with what that is were the conditions a for the radicalisation of the there impoverished subsequently them sufficient with them to the germans the solution the  that was what enough strong and simple and that to guilty and build after a czechoslovakia an for several and with a strong minority german that should represent and when so well the role of the fifth spine that  the way and resulted the outbreak of the war

the second war world is difficult know if hitler mainly too of the be to the that what they control the bankers international in a principle or if all what that was was part of a plan without however the suffering of the jews european in the camps of concentration was the conditions a for the acceptance the state jewish in the society world
israel was founded officially in exodus and of way similar the way in that the be of war imposed to germany emerge the way towards the second war world with the proclamation the state of israel is was the brink for a third war
if the bankers international succeed  the nation jewish the as that in the second war world is would in victim in first line of which now together with the population arab or generally muslim the east a

do who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict palestinian israeli do where the injustice rise injustice in a spiral of violence that if the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their now for the power world
in this point is necessary distinction between the inhabitants of israel and their authorised because the as that is in our country the bankers international only have to their candidates in the elections
the current president of israel b netanyahu is the typical example of political fascist marketing to the bankers international that ago all what possible for on the war to iran and recital that iran is member of the organisation of cooperation of shanghai china india russia pakistan threaten in become in a conflict global and if we in account that iran controls the close of  for where is the 20 of all the oil world the corridor of navigation has only two miles of wide would to the destruction of the economy world

the commission european is for saying that with this only search harmonisation the rules national not  to the date that only  their marketing
the rules that do reference to fruit and vegetables in the eu to despite of the opposition of some states is have no on the basis of that the directive existing means a waste of grocery
the candidate to win the survey could be the requirement of the eu the year last according the which in the much  that is market is compulsory have that the children under of 8 years not are authorised to  without the supervision of a adult
the eu was reference here to a study american according the which when is about of toys the much are the main cause of death child for asphyxia
also is existing a restriction similar applies the use of  for part of children of to 14 years
born even in our country
also absurd is the regulation which to the officials european all at that have any role official in the eu not can use the designation of macedonia for not eventually the sensitivity of greece is must about of fyrom pointed pointed pointed of macedonia
the servant  com in cooperation with the partnership of economists liberals    in the survey between some proposals absurd mentioned more down the requirement of the union on the volume of the has of food in the territory of a state member
the eu  the volumes were of has of food that can technically in the territory of the republic czech the same day of our entry to the eu
after the republic czech estimated for example the volume established for  in retains what that you an a threat of fined substantial
to the organizers of the survey also them was the commonplace of pay to those countries that not have access the sea and the idea of give a subsidy for the request of subsidies
this class of ideas not arose in brussels but in prague
apos we in disadvantage for the fact of not have sea
we to the union european a compensation apos declared in autumn the 2004 the then minister of agriculture
what destabilise with the fact of that in our country is was a crop and as result of the called purchases of intervention the state had the stores in and is had that export
according  given that the republic czech is far of the ports seaports the eu should  hundreds of million of eur
the end the commission european is was ready to help to the republic czech and organised a contest public for the buying the crop of the countries that not have access the sea
the subsidy for receive a subsidy was proposal to the municipalities for the ministry for the development local at for the minister     specifically is from to the significant of applications of subsidies of brussels
eu the hearted rare are a exception
the guidelines of the states member are to often white of criticisms the efforts of the eu in on of there and also a functioning and development more they in all the union deserve more well according several experts our recognition
according the experts the problem more serious is for example the collection of subsidies of the eu for projects that not have nothing that see with the deepening of the integration european but that the states member have managed in the negotiations on budgets
to the czech also them is the very sensitive the same way that to other countries of the union the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their products traditional although our country not always has out de of these
the czech after six years of disputes with germans and austrian against with success the designation of origin the  of  but had that christening the name the rum national whose tradition in our country is back the century 19th and happened to unfair apos  apos
only the products processing to from the distilled of cane of sugar can be called rum but not those facts to from of beet of sugar
in the list official of geographical of origin protected of the eu together with the cheeses from and gorgonzola known in all the world the  of the city german  or the parma of parma already is are for example the shortbread of karlsbad karlsbad the  of  and of  and even the variety of hop of
as  protected of the eu will be proud the the bread of  of  and the karlsbad of  greens
the people to that save the republic but i a amateur says
mr senator do how is you happened stand to the elections for president
not is is of be senator or president
if in our country outside all well then not would my candidacy
but already not i bear see how is stolen in the last twenty years in our country how the honour are go is increase the tax and the age of retirement
not had ambitions of be political
when i something that not i like attempt give with a solution for amended
and since that already i forty years and my candidacy is independent the only possibility that i of change the things is imagine as senator or president
the senate already has come but little after is has since in way towards the presidency
do not is giving the on to those people that what have voted
always i that my candidacy to the presidency it of the results in the elections the senate
more later  that if was elected senator would my candidacy to the presidency
but my aim not is the role the role is the tool with the that i to reality my own ideas
for that need the greater influence possible and the mandate more strong possible
the problem not is only that let a nation that criticize in the bar or front of the television but that  to who that wants an a change
to this is you these the media of communication that you discredit and who the freedom of expression with the freedom of lie
of me is says that i  to journalists or that i been advisory of paroubek paroubek
we to about of their ideas
is is to the fight presidential with would financial and responsibilities criminal of political and the declaration of the property for above of twenty million
for this must change the law
as president not has this competition and only the senate in their whole can propose laws
do how to resolve
as citizen i have part of a group of pressure for that the profession of guide is it as work be and what we
the problem is in the policy if someone is with a good proposal already be of right or of left is this to purpose and this affects to the citizens
as candidate independent have of a greater potential for obtain the support of all the groups parliamentary
without  not undistorted of party i the capacity of power decisions something of every party that be better for our country and apply
do is as more well a man of right or of left
since the point of view czech i the impression that the people i as more of left
for me not has importance already be a little of left or a little of right
what that i care is that want forward
not i care if someone is of right or of left i bring to the people
always support openly any solution good regardless of if the proposal next the  or of the ods and the same way i in against of the poor ideas
ago joke when is says of  that is populist
do but not what is proving with what that says
when is creates a plan business for the company you also certain objectives and ideals
and   to them
will who what something populism but all the proposals of the that i already work in the world or known experts about of them
but without the support the parliament only you are slogans
and with this not can survive in the policy to long term
do or believes you that if is at to the people and about with them will for example a responsibility criminal and financial
not i other option
convince to political to journalists and to the society civil and try them of my part for this
if outside elected president not would problem in organise a governing in direct for television in the which would to the leaders of the parties parliamentary that  the responsibility criminal and financial for political officials judges and tax the state
and eventually them should that communicate t not what want
if there a apos strong that out the disputes is can to pressure in the scene policy
take for case the election direct the president that has been a achievement of the pressure public
the same time i that only i a amateur not i not a out not a intellectual
for my views and ideals attempt to allies
i of start in the policy and attempt obtain the greater support possible for my programme
attempt from the things forward i same but in case of that not from well within of six years what getting and i the sector private
sounds a little as if  outside to save the republic czech
not i no salvador
i that with a person not i nothing for that i visited to a series of personalities known for if to what better is  to it their candidacy the senate
i to see to   but is refused because had a work
for my part for what least i supported to the journalist of research   that his to the light the fraud with cheeses covered of heating
i i that of the basis of that the people is really dissatisfied now i in the balance
the sixty for cent of the population not turned to the ballot and those that what did voted to the representatives the establishment
in the senate we two the sector independent
the people was the senate of such way that will complicated achieve changes
without however i defend my own ideas as for example the election direct of mayors or of governors
do is recital be their own party
still not what i have because not i time for this for check the last unblemished of every one of the potential member the party not not i money
not i money not for the campaign to the presidency in my account transparent only there 20 000 billion
do not has money
about of statements of the property do how is the their
clarification my property private in a 60 million
in prague i a ground valued in 25 million a out valued ten million another out  in eight million a published of works of art with a value of ten million a  martin of a 3 5 million and a   valued in a million and in the account i a couple of million
for true i a  martin because was my dream of youth always i pleased james rantings that seeing this car was  with the women and the same time elites against the  and injustices
do leads a  martin their property is valued in 60 million and not has money for the campaign
says that to change the republic but not to to too money of their part
not is very convincing
not i 15 million for the campaign
do i that
in the campaign already i since 2 5 million
the fact of that not have no  shows that not there too interest in my programme
and not i the duty of pay the campaign with money of my pocket
the expenditure of the campaign cover in essence what that get in concept of salary of senator
but not could live of this for example not could pay to my son the school english that costs 30 000 billion month
if i only win money then not i would as candidate
do so that will with their activity business for power live
do not has said before that was to to this activity
this not has nothing that see with a salary greater
as i promised in part i longer my activities
for example the representative of my agency of travel will to be my substitute in spring
the people would that outside the  that  the republic
but i also need live of something
do how loosen to win monthly as his
between 200 000 and 400 000 that i gaining
if outside president then nonetheless the business
can put all the interview in the edition the saturday of
the study of architecture  shows that the real adventures not only are in the head in the example of the library of  and the new draw apos mountain of books apos 2 photos
apos i that the building is fun has a aspect  and for end there something interesting that see apos says   a passer that is for the street
and füle  technical of you in a great company on close of the library as apos also the building is it apos
but i i wonder for what need a library today in day
all we internet medication and books electronic
nobody enter for will in these libraries past of fashionable do not
a city bedroom on to the doors of arrive that hardly deserves a  visit holds the questionable honour of have levies with a record for forget
the population of 80 000 inhabitants is the rate of literacy more low of the countries netherlands
for to this situation so scandal ago some years is decided make of any way to the culture general and imitation the seven bridges false that officer represented in the notes of euro in way of  of concrete system
the success of the for educational was limited
and so was as the responsible political you that only there a possibility for improve the statistics is had that build a library
the study of architecture dutch  all a master in the art of the  of there and responsible of buildings funny to the couple that commonwealth is took the issue with their her calm and lively to the presentation the contest in the year 2003 with five books under the from and a basic in the face
and while the jury looked oswiecim to their around and is  of shoulders  arrested to up the books for size its a pyramid and brought their brief speech with the following words apos ladies citizens
here the you my proposal for the mountain of books of  the called  apos apos
nine years after the mountain of 30 million of eur is comments in the place to
this way part the project of revival that is full with a parking underground a supermarket a office of post and a couple of buildings of housing and
to principles of november the mountain of books was medallists with the second prize apos apos  of nl 2012 apos
also the project also is  the apos  national prefer  2012 apos
of this way the small city sake of history that to the date not had nothing more that offer that a area smartest  and a city incredibly liver after whose on white one  more well a central country account now with a labour of architecture contemporary
but on all  at now the first building cultural public of their history
the long way to the book
the first impression is that is is of a paradise of books under a
well is true that there a lift that we hold fair the centre of this plants  but the real achieve the space and the reading not what use but that prefer  with their  to every step of their escalation to the top
the internal completely  is celebrity and easy of cover with the view the soil of mortar  and the elegant  support of way unequivocally the condition public of the library
the environment urban is perfect
the raise the view is can to to  the banks the park the dogs and the children and girls playing the football
and for all both books books and more books
apos normally the shelves of books are willing to what long of the on and in the centre is opens a huge room whites that for what general is be something be and impersonal apos says
what that we fact us is to this down the classical configuration space and from the area of reading the internal the foreign
the internal of the mountain is very well tapped in the a is are the offices the library of internet the club of being the centre of education environmental and the room of peacekeeping
is special deserve the shelves this that anyone the duties of diamond   and  the same time
the view the you and the  are strangers
even the architects and the engineers civil more the day shake the head when already about of this material unknown
apos we work with materials recycled apos we explains   head the project in the city of
and so is as a day in a exploitation agricultural  we brings with the feed appropriate from of the agriculture
since ago many years in the greenhouses and in the camps of the countries netherlands is used a fabric plastic of scarce millimetres of thick as basis for  the roots of the crops
is is of a material cheap and efficient
this fabric fine hard two stations and after is abandoned
for the library this fabric is  for first time in such quantities to get revised of four centimetres of thick
with the heat and the pressure the called plastic agricultural  time of colour and is becomes in a material dark international and durable that of to a a of car new and  of sport
after  sunlight is is to the top of the mountain
the end of this route continual of almost 500 metres around of the mountain we facing the to since the cafeteria not only is has a fantastic view of the city but that in she also is can enjoy of a beside  dutch and their  planted in enormous pots
these do a environment way to the couple that have the content air appropriate for this mountain of literature
donations for a new soul
apos although full believe in their large land as this building is a project exemplary in what that as to the ecology apos out
the heating and the cooling necessary is are to from of energy geothermal
to despite of that the mountain of books is on under a huge pyramid of glass even in the days more  the sun only which for few hours in their internal
the enormous  of wood this in sense mind to the on of glass serve for give shadow and indicating the majority of the rays the sun
this creates a climate internal
the rest is thing of the pulled it
füle  the scepticism worker the sector of the technologies of the information already is has courage to to the ordinary in the new library
and   also has state there
also the teacher of medicine traditional china her  has visited the library she described the apos  apos as the apos soul that apos of
the reason is that with reason of the opening that had place ago a couple of weeks is invited to all the inhabitants of the city to donate a book of their published private
of this way is to fill of at the missed  of a library that still not account with their for completely in the today has 70 000 copies
the concept has sure noticed
the shelves are teem
apos not there nothing worst that a library a empty apos says the architect
apos i that thank to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a true link with this building
all know that their book way part of the library
although only is there for embellish
of this way the study  has managed all a success in that discipline as that in the  specialises is known as apos creation of a identity apos
the city of  has writing a part of the history of the literature
regardless of what young and  that can be
for end a point of starting for shaping their identity
apos the germans must play a role more leading apos
germany is has abstained in the vote on the admission of palestine
according stephen  expert in the relations us us europe this is to berlin in a position diplomatic quite tricky
deutsche  to principles of week germany was to understand that would in against of the proposal of give to the territories palestinians the condition of state observer of the nations un
without however finally berlin is abstained
do for what
stephen  germany not supports what that the israelis have fact in gaza
now well because to the relationship special that unite the country with israel germany must have care
but the same time i that not supports the position american
germany wanted demonstrate their independence without be too criticism with israel
for the embargo that had place in libya in march of 2011 germany also is abstained when of what that is was was of establish a area of ban of flight
this has been avowed finally for the nato
do you is difficult to germany adopt a position clear when are in game subjects international important
yes so is
this is must to that in these at is direction their policy foreign moving of a policy led for so say for the states united and on in a policy foreign german
and what that difficult still more the things is that the european not have a policy coherent and uniform
for what therefore the germans is are in a crossroads
of them is expected that play a role more independent but not are used to do
i that still are operating what will their role but already have on the way towards a policy foreign apos normal apos
a policy foreign similar to the countries as france or great britain
do what means specifically a policy foreign apos normal apos since the point of view german
is a policy that when is is of interests national is shows ready to defend clash different to the of states united or their partners european
i that the policy foreign german is a strong motivation in the policy economic is say in the exports and in their relations with certain regions as can be russia china or east next
the interests economic germans are to true point different to the of other large powers and for that reason germany must protect their interests
do these interests economic have affected in the position adopted with regard the conflict in east next and in the vote of the un
for a on germany account with large markets in east next especially in the gulf
for this reason must be sustainably and not alienate of the opinion public arab not not of the élite arab
this is important for course
but i not you would so importance since that not is is of a relationship completely unilateral
without however yes play a role fundamental in the considerations german
do has stake germany their relationship with us us the abstain of vote in important decisions as in the vote on palestine
i that in europe and even in states united the position german degree of a huge degree of understanding
for this reason not i that is has there a past so drastic as in the case of libya
perhaps with this germany has achieved apos a true respect
the end and the out all this not has fact but demonstrate that is a country the that take in seriously as actor international and whose interests there that have in account
in europe there different views about of the initiative palestine
in change us us is has shown clearly to favour of a veto
do there differences of views between us us and many nations european
always have said these disparities because to the policy internal us
i that the government of obama shows in secret a great understanding towards the position european
but to cause of the situation policy that is live here is clear that the government not can defend in public that position
i that the real differences of views not has in reality the in that is you attaches
if we the relations between obama and the first minister israeli netanyahu we that obama not is for nothing himself with the policy that develops
do you is difficult to germany reconcile the links relations that maintained with israel and states united for a on with the position of their main partners in the eu for another
i that is precisely that what that ago that be so difficult for the germans
for course that would a little more easy for the germans if existed a policy european coherent and allowing but not is the case
for what therefore not have the possibility of be part of a to higher but that must promote the things since their own position
that is precisely what that are doing now with the euro
i that in the future germany will a role of leadership to the time of they to europe to adopt a position european
for course that this not is nothing easy for germany already be simply for the relationship that maintained with israel
this has been always a issue tough
but i that the germans have clear that must play the role of on independent
do is is germany to yes same in the role of actor international important do to in reality germany in a role leading
do or perhaps you still underdeveloped difficult accept that leadership
germany still not is has have always is something you and for for obvious the country you still collapse play a role more important
if we the crisis the euro for example we that every time that germany is essential as actor main is when certain feelings
this not is easy for the germans
is is of a old problem and is that nobody to be surrounded of the countries enemies
seen of this way germany is is in a position a more difficult that states united
must show a attitude inclusive with to the different neighbours and views and that not is easy
the influence of us us in the policy european ever every time more but the eu not cover of at that vacuum do who is then
to the germans not them will more no that in a role more leading
even if not them like if them is unpleasant or if them becomes in a people still more unpopular c apos est the vie

apos protection of trademark apos in china when  and around is become of suddenly in trademark chinese
around is a mark known to level world and side   also
but do what is around side
after this name is behind a designation has officially in china but that not has nothing that see with the companies original
not however this degree of protection while the real  not be a demand
and even then not is clear that is them will to give the reason
apos to the foreign them is every time more difficult protect their trademark in china apos out he  lawyer the  an  specialises in violations of rights of protection in extreme east
every week is to my table a new case
the imitators simply in a couple of says for power record their trademark
of this way  is becomes in   and in place of  is with
the companies german also is copied legally of the same way such and as you has happened the manufacturer of articles quot
opens a data in the that have seats of the office of trademark of beijing
the 14 of september of 2010 a company china which record the mark    a name artificial that also is useless of the home of fashionable
that the chinese are champions world in that of imitation and of all the rights of property intellectual is of too known
in the large cities there large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting
without however the cases of  are of other a for charge of their customers he fight against the fact of that the office of trademark granted of way official to the companies chinese the right to from from of a designation that already is has in another place
the chinese what refer apos bang   apos or mark and
the word has their origin in the term chinese apos bang  apos
that ago reference to women that have apos fish apos to a man rico
the authorities chinese not is feel guilty
apos is harmful for the business there that fight against this apos requires
apos the mark ago water the position monopolist disappears and the damage that suffering the image is huge apos
the losses financial and the as procedural of the sectors affected are  on all in the case of products flagship of luxury
according data of the company of analysis of market  with a volume of 15 000 million of eur the year china is in size the third market of articles of luxury and the that overall to greater pace
without however achieve the acts of enrolment of doubtful legality in the registration of trademark is complicated and also is a money
the processes is can over to nine years and the result is uncertain
about of cases in the that the court rejected a demand because had appropriations therefore time that the name subject of the demand already is had become in a apos reality of market apos
apos if the they has bad fortunately perhaps even have that pay money the  because the process has damage to the mark of this in china apos out
in times this is the law of the jungle
some of the cases more known have that see with elements graphic
in 2009   lost a he against the manufacturer of machinery of construction  the company that has been taken ago little for the manufacturer german of bombs of concrete
for that to day of today the chinese can to being a seeking very similar to the star of mercedes
the one of corresponds  his the principle a logo in white and blue that had in great measure to bmw the issue is  in the courts and  had that has
the manufacturer of clothes  lost in china against imitators from of kong kong and singapore whose logo represented a crocodile still in the direction opposite the original
the authorities chinese not is feel guilty
the office of trademark  in beijing recognised that in 2010 have had difficulties because to the shortage of equipment and funding of personal
the year last without however apos the situation of emergency labour the to the as apos
of this way the amount of processes of complaint without  is has small in a 22
almost 57 000 of these cases is properly been a 75 more that the year previous
without however 81 500 complaints are outstanding of resolution
fight against this costs a money
as is be her in china the figures are surprising
the year last the  registered more of 1 4 million of applications of protection of trademark almost a third more that in 2010
is would of a new record and means that china  for tenth year running the list of new enrolment in all the world according out the office of trademark
seems that this also happens with the number of which valid figure that out to 5 5 million in total
in 2011 is would  1 800 million of donated in concept of rights
said of other way this means that of average every register costs 1  donated or 160 eur
fight against this costs a money such and as shows the case of the company family german
since ago more of seven years the group fight in the courts against a  chinese
if well the germans have managed stop the manufacture illegal of parts of car of imitation
the  has achieved ensure the rights chinese on the mark
apos us ourselves we caused this situation because in germany the surnames not are protected apos out   president and   of    in munich
the office of trademark  also rejected the appeal of the
in the two following bodies you have given the reason to  but the part opposite still fronts in the today
there that have great care
now the case has come to the doors the court higher of justice where still outstanding of resolution
responding in power resolve welcome the question and rationale the professionalism of the courts
without however also says that apos the procedure is extremely expensive therefore in terms of money as of time apos
is difficult estimate the costs internal the for business has had that review conclusion of to hundred years of old for power to evidence
ago five years  promised to the part opposite a apos sum of six figures in eur apos with the aim of to to a agreement friendly but not had success
apos this shows what a that we care apos out
the dangers that dictatorial in extreme east are even with affect to europe
specifically if the imitators is they there the rights on trademark not protected
so a manufacturer chinese tried record in germany the name  for shoes and products of fur
ago time that the group occasion this area trade not however in prevent the register
apos there that have great care apos says
therefore he as the lawyer  proposed to the companies german that are extremely careful to the time of to business with china
not enough with rely in the legislation international on rights of mark but that what that there that to is apos record also in china all what that can be for of protection apos such and as as
of what contrary the issue can be a more expensive that a simple registration
of fact in case of that  mutual the last assault of their battle particular then would that pay to the part opposite rights of licence for their own name such and as explains
that or in the segment in question we  the market

this was and still be open to the interpretation and seems that the islamists will to take this vague one so as the for of manoeuvre legal that has thereby for impose a interpretation more strict of the sharia
this is the least what that suggests a new article added in all the issues relating to the sharia is compulsory put to the university the  the institution islamic more important the country with a great power in all the an uighurs

what that also is problem is that to keep the jurisdiction military

a fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic square tahrir where started all would caused a situation similar to the of a war civil

the brothers muslims said that therefore the that is who the draft of the constitution as the supporters the same would expressed their views high and clear

my crisis of identity mexican us
says that many is were forced to leave mexico because to the lack of opportunities
the mexican tend to criticise to the that is were says that reminiscent to the mexican of those times difficult
observing that the mexican americans is are trapped between two worlds
in a recent journey to city of mexico hardly had down for the on and come to the area of out of immigration and already was completely confusing
a notices did the way towards two on a for apos mexican apos and other for apos foreign apos
i was there a seconds without be sure towards where should go
the have grown in california central for all my life i have called apos mexican apos
is is of  ethnic the same way in that my friends of  is refer to yes ourselves as apos irish apos or my friends of new york is as to yes ourselves apos italian apos
more later i decided for apos mexican us apos
but this was mexico
and in the homeland of my grandfather the  or the paragraphs not were necessary
simply was us
i spanish what enough well as for  for a interview in this language
but not i the level of vocabulary of a  and not i  of my accent american
so that i my passport us and i i in the eu of foreign
i in at at of this week in the that the president elect of mexico eight  grandson visited the home white for meet with the president obama
in the agenda the day as always that is meet the leaders of these two countries rest immigration drugs and trade
grandson was look about also the growth of the economy mexican a of the reasons for the that in these at is so likely that a mexican is be in mexico as that is draft to go to the states united
to partner with states united and canada and create in america a bloc trade the lifestyle of the union european
also  grandson promised to fighting against the which of the drugs in mexico although not was details
for mexico the relationship with the states united is difficult and is full of grudge
probably the majority of americans never is remember of that in 1848 the states united invaded mexico and belonging to their leaders to yield the half of their territory to is of gunpoint
but for the mexican that think in centuries not in minutes the elements that is what reminiscent are for all parties
so that in the at in the that a official of the states united says any thing that such the more minimum criticism to mexico  to hear complaints therefore in the press as between the elite mexican on how the americans are  the sovereignty of their neighbours
and the children of  is are in ordinary of war
and still so for mexico the relationship that really is all a challenge is the that have with the more of 35 million of mexican americans that live in the states united
do we of grudge
there a
in mexico there winners and losers people for the that the country being opportunities and other for the that not is so
the only reason for the that there many people of hungarians mexican living in cities as the examined the  as denver or st for is that in some point of our tree  there a person can that the father or the mother or one of the grandparents to the that is you closed the door of the opportunities in mexico and had that leave towards the north
and the majority of the sometimes that person cumbersome in a profile particular fur whites a level of studies under from of a people poor etc
us we their top and them we loyal
to mexico not
and to despite of that perhaps we living now the dream american the have gone to good schools and have had good jobs not we lose never of view that what that we living is that the dream american and not the mexican
is possible that to sometimes our identity not is clear but our loyalty yes that what is
is for the states united
also we aware of that to many of the mexican lot to the elite of the class leader not them
the sense is mutual
we are as a reminder of a defeat humiliating and we who for above the card as if about of a category than that not is what enough mexican
our spanish never will what enough good and our links with mexico never will what enough strong
to their way of see our existence is synonymous of failure
if our families not would failed in mexico not is would gone
and now not we be trapped after this curtain of cotton living well in the states united but still so as souls
my woman that born in standing and wine legally to the states united when was a girl i reminds that there this  between the mexican and the mexican americans because the first know with more strength who are and to the seconds this them bother
although is citizens of the states united she is as part of the two countries
while therefore many mexican americans that know feel that not are part of none of the two
we love listen the group mexican the tigers the north but also to
you what better of every country but not you rooted to none of them
in mexico we are as americans
and in the states united is we as mexican
now for making still more the things for what that i i have for my journey some leaders mexican and some intellectuals want again to connecting with the diaspora
want that the mexican americans work as apos ambassadors apos of mexico accommodation been their interests in the states united
to our colleagues americans what fantastic that is visit that country and  to the leaders political for that  their links with mexico
yes clear
that not is to to
there too grudge
and with the inequality of wages the corruption rampant and the violence for drugs many of us not we so insurance of that be a country fantastic
i fear that you sötét to be alone with this idea friends
is fair
if some mexican still not are prepared for pardon to the states united for the way in the that were to mexico ago a century and a then have that accept the fact of that some mexican americans still are paid for how is was to their family ago great least time

perhaps let more apos mexican apos of what that i
this battles new east a
the high the ceasefire between israel and hamas well could be a basis little likely for the peace
do will have some day a peace lasting between arab and jews in east a
another bloodletting of blood that seems indicate that any hope is in vain
in a of the so and arise discussions on who began first examples of buildings have been lower to rubble more of 140 palestinians the majority of them civil and six israelis have been killed and for first time rockets from of gaza have fallen close of tel tel the heritage of israel and the city holy of jerusalem
but to despite of that the israelis and the palestinians seem be sections in their former conflict all as them are in east a is changing
the spring arab what has longer all fact armour them whether or not palestinians and israelis have been trapped in the mighty regional
perhaps this do that their fight be still more bloody that before
without however there reasons for think that their lethal situation of point died could
a war that not is lose not is earns
to first view the optimism seems currently very difficult of justify
even if is maintained the high the ceasefire agreed the 21 of november the clashes of this week have reinforced to the hawks of both sides
the leaders of hamas the movement islamist that has we gaza since 2007 have have forced to the israelis to from to despite of that gaza has received a good yourselves
and to despite of have killed to some of their leaders and trouble to pressure to the 1 7 million of inhabitants of gaza in one of the they more districts and populated the planet israel not has been end with hamas
of fact hamas is gaining ground in west the other part of palestine currently ruled for their implacable rival of fatah the  palestine more moderate
also the leaders of hamas could to to the conclusion of that the time apos to their favour
given that the islamists have gone gaining influence for all the world arab hamas has fact  richest and powerful
turkey a  power regional that before had been the ally muslim more have to israel has espoused the cause of hamas also what has fact qatar one of the states more rich and enjoy the gulf
the  member of hamas say that the average moon islamist is style israel since the lebanon the north where dominates the party constant  and for syria where the rebels of a trend every time more islamist could bring to  el to to to jordan where the allies of hamas are threatening the king
on all in the with south of israel the growth of the brothers muslims targeted for the president   in egypt with difference the more populated and fundamental of the countries arab has changed the balance of the region
hosni mubarak the  guarding that period in egypt for 30 years to their fall in 2011 not had too time for hamas
in change the brothers muslims are extended brothers of hamas and their leaders on more of the opinion popular
in future actions diplomatic is possible that hamas involved as leading the that not is can from not even israel and the states united
while therefore the arrived hard of israel surrendering the conclusion opposite
in what that is as the question military have since to hamas in their website
the system antiballistic  of iron of israel has shown their effectively and many of the rockets of hamas have been destroyed
the israelis  more so for some time
in as to the diplomacy states united is shows more firm that never many countries european also  to hamas of have on the last wave of violence
to all israel has been especially under the government of benjamin netanyahu a first minister that has ignored widely the process of peace
although the rockets fired since gaza have over with the life of a 30 israelis since 2004 israel not has had many terrorists suicide in part thank to the barrier that  west the main part of a territory aspiring to become in state of palestine and it the settlements jews that are increasing to despite of that according the legislation international are illegal
the mr netanyahu whose party fighters is has uk to a group of a line still more hard led for   in the period run to the elections the 22 of january is in a good position
do for what  to these  palestinians  a state own
if really  in west do not  rockets such and as have fact their compatriots in gaza
is better they after that wall and them a good coup if rose the head
perhaps is will the arrived hard although the spring arab could tamper their are
although the islamists that take the power in egypt and in other websites not have too hold to israel their priority will address the difficulties internal
the budget of defence of israel is greater that the of their four neighbours arab together
an a war with the superpower of the area hardly will to the new governments arab to improve their economies
that the may mr  has worked with barack obama for get the high the ceasefire is a good well and could usher the beginning of something
also the israelis should think to long term
with the rest the world arab inventive more democratic deprived to the palestinians of their right to the self is create a sitting that a day  in the territories occupied for israel of the same way that this week catholic a bus in tel tel
the repression already is destroying the democracy in the state jewish and the demography worse the situation to measure that is the population arab
the  missions against gaza every two or three years for reject to hamas they a toll diplomatic every time greater
both sides need a right of people which the conflict
the solution still being the that  people sensible of both sides the majority the world foreign and this newspaper two states and the up of territory for part of israel for reasons of security
the hope small to short term is that the high the ceasefire given a little more of momentum to the people which that are fighting for this cause
egypt that must start to to curb to the entry of weapons in gaza together with turkey and qatar is is in a situation without unprecedented for convince to hamas of that accept the idea of a state jewish based in the borders of 1967 with exchanges of land and a jerusalem shared
the arab outsiders the issue also should on to hamas and fatah for that is join
that help more to the creation of a state palestinian that the imminent attempt of obtain a category of state virtual in the un
the mr obama also has a important role in what that as to get to to israel to the table of negotiating
for their first mandate  it their own plan for the peace
of new in the home white seems as of promote to unique their attention
this attitude is a record vision of future
a east a stable is of vital interest for the states united
this means a agreement of peace between israel and palestine

for the testing the day of action of thank of this year of way unexpectedly i that to five hours in a airport because the air in the that  was a problem engineering and had that wait to that would another air
so that i great time for think in the platitude
not you i to lie
a day in a airport waiting to that it a flight is quite boring even if you media for be apos as books weeklies or  without ignore of the shops duty free
but every time there more academic and experts in development child that praising the shot the platitude
according them is well that therefore us as our children we  of time in when
never forced the brain to to options interesting and can that encourage the creativity
given that currently the majority of us we connected to this or to that screen not we the profits that provided the platitude
so that do should accept of good mind the platitude
yes
and not
but already we of this more forward
in first place the as that very people supposed that now that we of more time for the leisure the platitude would a phenomenon relatively recent
but such and as says peter  professor of history greek and roman of the university of calgary in canada and author the book apos  to   apos apos the platitude a history encouraged apos published in 2011 for  university associated not is so
apos of fact the history the platitude is very can apos says
in the walls of  there  in latin on the platitude that ponds the century i d c
also we ourselves how define the platitude
apos the problem is that already is has defined and discussed of very various ways apos points john d  professor of  of the university of york in  canada
after at the research premises and raise the idea to a group of discussion have for 100 people the professor  and their colleagues defined the platitude as the experience of apos desired but not power participate in a activity that you full apos
says that the difference between the platitude and the wrestling is that the person not ago something but to do
out that with the wrestling not there the i of to something
the experience main the platitude says is apos the at the process of attention associated to a under state of mind and to a that of that the time is slowly apos
the platitude can sounding safeguarding apos to the depression
without however the professor  says that although they be related the people that are tedious tend to see the problem as a question the environment or the world while that the people that are poorest they that the problem what have them
to sometimes we that we boring when what that we is in reality is that we problems for with
in their study apos the     in  of  apos published in the edition of september of the magazine  on  bamst the professor  and their colleagues is were to a experiment previous in the that the participants  a cut of a person that surplus the article of a magazine
some groups took in the room neighbouring a programme of television to all volume that not bore no relationship other what took with the volume under of way that hardly was justifiable while that the third group not listened the audio in no at
the group that listened the programme with the volume under was more platitude that the other two groups them cost focus but not were insurance of for what and what  the platitude
apos when   in a task difficult or interesting the at of the attention can to the platitude apos pressed mark donnelly  professor of  of the university of  in  and one of the authors the study
apos for another on when you doing something boring as detect parts unprepared in a line of manufacture a music that you  you can help to not  apos
apos of fact currently we that get or to  actions that to often is are as sign of platitude can in reality help to combat already that do that that person is physically more vigilant apos
apos the research shown that those children to the that is them allows get about more and observation more information that those to the that is them forced to be advances apos says the professor
all we what that is never in some at the delay of a air a speaker whilst a film especially uninspiring
but some people have more trend to never that other
for help to  some researchers perfectly in the years 80 a apos scale of trend the platitude apos
the scale includes issues as apos many of the things that i that to are repetitive and  apos and apos there many things that i interested that not i time of do all apos
stephen  professor of  of the university of west florida says that being these levels the researchers have discovered that the boys have more trend to never more to often that the girls and specifically need more stipulation external and more diverse
but in general the adolescents are a kind of group that is boring with quite easily
in 1991   professor of development human and community of the university of illinois was to out a experiment in the that is were in contact with 400 adolescents and with their parents between seven and eight sometimes the day by a search
found that the 32 for cent of the adolescents said that is  while was in the school or doing the duties while that the 23 for cent said that is  when not was in the school
for another on the 3 for cent of the parents were that is
the professor  said that not was if the rates of platitude current 21 years after would with or lower
but said that what that yes was was that apos the adolescence is a period in the that the platitude high their correctness more highest apos in great part because to that therefore to the children as to the adolescents not is them of a great control on what that want to
so that back to my question the principle do is good never
to sometimes not what is already that taken the extreme can to that we exposing to risks physical absurd as to betting or fall in the consumption of substances as method for combat such and as shown the research
for another on many established and writers about of the connection between the platitude and the creativity according says the professor  that has state at this question for more of two decades
apos the platitude is the way that has the brain of word that we be doing other thing apos says paranoid  professor of  of the university of new york
but the brain not always know what is what more appropriate
if you boring and you that energy for play the  or cooking that you satisfy
but if don the television is possible that you who to short term but not to long term
apos so that if your son is boring and you feed a ipad is possible that already not is  but not will learned to full for yes same or to  apos says the professor
and apos that capacity of  is applies to other situations apos out
your son not only you to full for yes only but that you to unchecked better in other areas
not i that really want impressed the platitude
but not should be too critical with he
our aim should be more well the of be close paragraphs the rumour constant of the activities and the technologies
the professor  is of agreement
apos to our way of see need  more but the platitude is a i too distressing and disturbing as for feel with something that deserves the it apos says
out that what that the people really search is a way of off and of enjoy of a time died
apos in a environment in the that we constantly  apos says apos is difficult find forms of focus our attention when the noise by apos
colorado without book of instructions for the new law on the consumption of marijuana

apos we are as to criminal apos says
do and what are
in the weeks of uncertainty following to the vote that had place in colorado for the legalisation of the prison of small quantities of marijuana for use hand the answer in hundreds of causes under for prison of drugs on least of the law that of the location
hundreds of crimes under for possession of marijuana is are overwritten therefore here as in the state of washington where is adopted a measure similar
the departments of police have longer of it charges against the are of 21 years for possession to small scale that is will legally a time the law has entered in force in the next weeks
but the tax of districts more conservatives of colorado is have committed to to forward with the cases open for possession of marijuana and still are quote to people
the same time several cities since the suburbs of denver to the mountains western are voting for prevent that is open shops of marijuana you recently in their communities
apos all this is changing so quickly that not i what will what next apos said daniel donnelly  head of police in  fair the this of denver

and are for advice for establish a system of licences of production manufacture distribution and sale all this before of that it the date limit the 1 of december of 2013
say that for well or for is colorado is for front of the majority of the states in as to the regulation the use of the marijuana first with for  and now for use hand
apos colorado at of a market more regulated so that will a good guide apos says brian and smith spokesman of the commission of control the alcohol the state of washington
but the mr smith accepts that any place or system only can to suggestions on what that could work
apos not there a real precedent that we as of model apos says
the law of washington called i  enter in force the 6 of december what that is also a year for the which is  between two water already that the system of licences in that state still not will but the possession will legal
also there some issues suffocation sensitive that must resolved for that period as the way of keep a balance between the demand the state of offer a apos access appropriate apos to the marijuana authoritative and their ban of to business of cannabis in a radio than to 300 metres of schools parks areas of game children or centres children
apos in no place will more difficult  a business of cannabis authorised that in the areas urban especially in the area cause of seattle apos says ben  spokesman the centre for the cannabis legal a group of research created recently
the 21 of november  the head of police of  sent a mail e to their players of police in the that them detectives of that the tax of the city nonetheless of prevail actions judicial for one very for possession of marijuana to people are of 21 years and of that the police nonetheless of it charges against these crimes apos with effect immediately apos
the head of police  said that them is away of to to the regulation of the city that regulates the as of marijuana with for therapeutic and that paid pursued to traffickers and sellers of drugs
in the county of  in the north of colorado the tax the district ken  represents a vision more strict
after the vote was that their office event pursued the cases of possession of marijuana mainly for on to the consumers and that is have to receive treatment
currently amounted people is face to charges for possession of 56 grammes or least of marijuana although many of them have other charges
apos our office has the duty of prevail actions judicial against those one that in the at in that is there were crime apos said the mr  in a declaration
the answer has been difficult even in places as the county rural of table where the voters rejected the initiative on the legalisation of the marijuana
the police of cardiff  the greater city the county already not quotation to adults for possession of small quantities
tax the district the county supported this decision but also decided not presented none of the cases outstanding for possession
apos not i that is losing the time the to doing to the law to that this changes apos stated
to despite of that the 55 for cent of the voters supported the measure never is was that to the consumption of marijuana for use hand the within the government and the system legal outside to be easy
the reactions contradictory that arise for all the state are of clear a marked ambivalence between the officials regard the great experiment create in this state
apos is is of a barrier cultural with the tax the district apos says are  a lawyer of denver that represents to the accused for possession of marijuana and that is spokesman local of the organisation national for the reform of the law on the marijuana

while lawyers and officials the state have with a new border of sales legal also expect desperately receive indications the government federal that still for the consideration of the sale and the as of marijuana as crimes federal
the defenders of the legalisation of the marijuana have the hope of that the department of justice stand
to despite of that is have there some leading arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for for therapeutic the government federal has allowed in their majority that there business of sale of marijuana with these for in colorado washington and 16 states more

therefore my father as my brother greater had state in the that i supposed was the better place the world for learn a symposium greek of the was contemporary that balanced the two pillars of the civilisation the thought free and the tolerance
without however to the two weeks of should my square in the  upon to end of the years 80 for welcome the career of history already had fact the bags what that triggered the first scandal of my life
my father is outset and is retraced to our
my friends were there
the newspaper the   stated that i had abandoned because not  that some colleagues of university maintained relations sexual in the room of the on
the he to no wilson announced jest that i had gone because i thrown to drinking in
the truth was least funny
of there
yes  because had state put to a systematic harassment and intimidation
not because to my  name not the fact of that from of a school private
i  for a only reason that in the cradle of the called illustration was something to and barbaric my father the keenly   was a apos advisory of margaret thatcher and i supported the party conservative
perhaps is ask to what next that now
well several reports show that a new generation of students of centre right is suffering a persecution similar
the hatred repentance and growing towards the students the party conservative is such in oxford that the week last a group of them called the same level of equal of rights that have the homosexual the disabled and the minorities ethnic
member conservatives of the  grouping of students of degree the corpus  upon claim that are apos to often seriously paragraphs personally attacked and treaties as people not objected apos for their ideas policies
want create a since in the committee of equal of opportunities of their school university for ensure of power express their views freely
their situation not is was offences for a recent documentary of the  called apos wonderland highlights  and on the  apos the paradise young it and of right on the policy of the students and that presented to the  as  and neo
the student of post    of the partnership the party conservative of the university of oxford  in a doesn doesn wearing a suit carefully and a bullfighting with the  of silver
in other universities the students conservatives say that is them is as apos them of turkish apos for the introduction of rates of s more higher
black of 20 years and vice of the partnership the party conservative of the university of name declared in a newspaper began that apos there a growing trend of left in the universities
the people helping that we as the  club without not so even  apos
thomas of 21 years and student of history in corpus  that presented the motion for a greater protection says that this environment is apos you apos while that   of 19 years and president elected of the  says that the attitude of the member of the  towards the people that are of centre right has worsened
apos this is a threat for the environment of debate intellectual so as for the welfare of the member apos says
for my first weeks in oxford i more single that the a
there in the university in september of 1986 was a young of 18 years safeguarding timid
the hatred towards the party conservative was in their point more high
the year previous the university had voted can to margaret thatcher former  a title apos szczeciń cause apos after the cuts in the funding of the education higher
the environment would fact horrifying of appalling to any stalinist
already for the first days of the week of welcome to the new it when the new students is know and know to the professors received a shows of the bitterness that i than
thoroughly that the professors not only the the view blind to the  that is was of the it conservatives but that involved in she of good earns
the policy of the strike of the miners the privatisation and the opposition the government to the sanctions against the apartheid in africa came to the rooms of wood the seminar
the first that i is be into the english texts french the century in and i not was ready for what that wine to continuation
apos   apos said the professor   already died apos for favour translates the first paragraph apos
not realised not a
a man  with a face that seemed mass of  was well how who bad
apos do is that the  is refuse to learn french or is that simply are his apos asked
the other it is laughed
i brought the eyes of the tears that was of contain
apos you suggest that will to classes of french in their time free always and when not is too occupied as people apos
returned to my room as a soul in it
that night i sat single to the time of the dinner in the university then felt a this pat in the on
was a student of english of second year called james that is presented as member of the
apos i who you apos i said politely
apos i fear that so is as is the thing
is mouths with who that be suspect of be hunted
for me is very complicated but know that your father is have to margaret thatcher so that for you will still worst
many  new newcomers  be labour apos
more forward in a public local i cowardly hide
stressed in that not was of agreement with all what that said the mrs thatcher
that trick was pointless
a student of first year of philosophy policies and economy that paradoxically had examined in  said apos you daughter of a pig fascist
you would apos
other students they that
i became in the laundry
apos do how have relations sexual the  apos asked one
apos is are a yourselves the one the another do not apos
i felt of the same way that should have sense the homosexual before of the law liberal of the years 60
do could some day to a life normal in oxford
do i be forced to be with people that thought as i only after the
do would that plenty labour and embraced my trends natural
the three years that i were is were as a going of condemnation and isolation
the only professor openly hunted was  smug professor of history contemporary aimed to my school university
you  for be not only the party conservative but also advisory of thatcher in policy foreign and a of the people that you go their speeches
hardly was for there
the place for that what he parochial and it and for their grip to the vision   of the history
in 1997 accepted a university in the university of  in ankara turkey
apos here not you to be happy apos i said
started to visit daily of oxford to home of my parents in london finding refuge in my family and friends of mentality cause more open
you i to my father that hated oxford and for what
not i believed
when he was there in the years 40 is deleting all the points of view political
apos but if is the better place the world apos said with sadness
apos them never would that not there between my dear overtime of dream
to my friends communist always had a attitude whiter apos
their  eyes they to
apos  other opportunity
i sure of that what have fact only for
is i tipperary the heart if what  apos
committed of many travel to london my resistance emotional is was deteriorating
a friend mine that also supported the party conservative had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced to their cultures
the week next for a seminar in the that another professor of history had hinted about completely in seriously that i was a apos enemy the people apos decided to what same
red of shame for within  that my parents i had apos laundering the brain apos and them notified apos old stupid apos
the truce for little time
was my father who it the last coffin in the coffin of my career university in oxford
for at then my father illiterate two  week in the press of murdoch
my door was closed with key
i was within  of fear and automatic five minutes my pull
when is were i the case and took the first train to london
never returned
perhaps i  weak
but no person of 18 years should be put to such level of intimidation and hostility in a institution educational
what that is still more tragic is that was oxford that not only has have to 14 first ministers the party conservative but that to day of today is behind after a ensure nothing deservedly of equal and freedom of thought

the sentences are part of a sum that used we local as apos we to to a   in the oven apos for laughing of the rate of birth of singapore
the company of advertising that was the webstreaming  hosts the hope of that with the announcement overriding draw the attention on the problem of a way funny
their director creative  hamilton says that wanted use the power of the music for that the people a with apos their duty national apos
this is something purely of internet so that had that do fun and funny
is the greater problem in this country
we the worst the world in  to us ourselves so that we that this was a issue that we that address
knew that the government had tried many things as launch perfumes with  or organise  of from spiralling
many of these ideas can have been creative but not necessarily worked
so that we do for what not we what more creative possible for as this problem that is  a sum
1 2 children
the that not is what decision so to the this is the government of singapore
spent  1 300 the year in policies for encourage to the citizens to have more children
a package the government for marriages and parents make to 15 000 dollars for child or the licences for leave and spread profits tax
but all this has had little effect
singapore is a city state rich and of high technology in the south of asia also known for the track of their leaders and their needed controls social
the rate of birth of singapore of agreement with their division national of population is is currently in 1 2 children for woman
the last time that was for above of 2 known as rate of  was in 1976
so that do for what the  not have more children
so   director of policies of marriage and family of the division national of population says that is because to a apos better education apos and apos a range more wider of opportunities of career apos
apos that you has allowed to the people have of a range more wider of options in terms of objectives of life and priorities more beyond of incorrect and be a family apos explains
these changes in the rules social have contributed the increase of the  and to delay the marriage and the problem what that of as result a in of the rate of birth in singapore
while therefore a policy of immigration eu is to increase drastically the immigration for to with to the in of the population has created umbrage between the population local
in singapore there websites website where rife the xenophobia hardly provision against many new immigrants in particular the chinese to the that critics for keep the wages netherlands and not integrated
the increase of the immigration also is seen as a of the reasons for the that the year last the party of government of singapore experienced their worst result electoral since the independence
since the elections has there a attempt of correct the problem with the quotas and taxes more higher for the workers foreign
consequences unexpected
while that the fall in the rate of birth has effects known in the growth economic of a nation the income tax the costs health and the policies of immigration the example of singapore also is taking some consequences unexpected
the government is that not is built many houses small
for example has started to affect the sector estate
the authority of development urban has last to control the number of over small known as apos box of shoes apos that is they build in certain areas of the city
these over have land of 46 metres square and have had a success of sales
without however there concern of that they promote a lifestyle of life of  and  to the developers that want build houses large family
but  quot soon director general of the company buildings the  says that their apos boxes of shoes apos is sold a more quickly that the units more large
are more popular in the sense of that the units is exhausted days even weeks more quickly that the units of greater size
this ago that be a better for our flow of box
without however accepts that the new rules are guidelines more clear for the developers to the that before is them were snags if wanted offer too units small in a project
too
singapore is a city state
if well these new rules can be a step towards the increase of the rate of birth national the about with the  that working in the district financial the centre prompt that not will to have a effect
apos the people is very opening the houses are sides and also what is the education for what that many people what are they apos says a young executive
other people can have children
apos but for me is important have with my own money and time apos says another young of a 20 years
men and women mention their career the stress and the costs of the properties and of the education as the for that them from have children
so that for a that the government involved of force to their citizens to have children when is is of to babies the  are who have the last word

then have aids was synonymous of death
now is possible survive to this syndrome and do with quality of life
without however uninformed of their disease still many people they when the virus already has caused havoc apos sitting apos their system immune and are victims of infections opportunistic
to 31 years of the emergence the aids in the world the least of the first cases reported apos the great achievement means in this at that the  of a patient that as treatment in way well and the  of the population general is exactly as apos pressed the head of the unit of hiv the     after referring that this information was supported in april of this year in a publication scientific
and expert in hiv aids   a that since the year 2008 the scientists had concluded that the aids not was a ruling fatal but the years of survival and the quality of life on the degree of  the system immune that have the patients the an the diagnosis with better expectation for who not are users of drugs of to 30 years with a  of 200  and of 50 years when our 500
in words simple what previous means that who a the diagnosis of hiv positive to the 25 years of age under these terms apos while is keep in control will live without problems to the 75 years apos he the ashraf
for  this progress is remember that the hope of life of the mexican today is of 76 years in average
if well the mortality has down significantly in the last years in the case of mexico the number of people that die of aids bowed of 6  cases in 2007 to 4  in 2011  annual of carriers also is true that since the emergence the aids 60 for cent of the patients in the basis of data national have died
only in  generously people died in 2011 and will  deaths to may of this year not however is will that there access universal to the drugs retroviral since 2005
do for what still they deaths
to me i seems that the problem not is of access to treatment
so what  so we has happened in our hospital
the least in the last 12 years not we had  of medicine the problem is that the patients they very advanced because not their state of infection or be in stages late of the disease
was a fact no apos nine of every ten patients they when already have any infection opportunistic what that is has that to for have a greater impact on the mortality global is to fresh more  and for what therefore is have that offer evidence of detection of way mass to all the people that what intensive apos
in their proposal line specialists and officials the council state of prevention the aids in   also the own patients as  who turned to done the test to a laboratory particular only drove because what had fact a friend and despite to their short age already was in stage of aids and even   of  a by cancerous that is a of the complications common

some think that is will to die and not want know nothing
apos if already i i to die better i  three sometimes to the week apos say not in my case

that is do the test if had risk that between more soon know if are hiv positive is better and if already have the diagnosis that learn that can live as any person being responsible
